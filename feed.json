The area next to the greenhouse previously had raised beds, so some paths are already in place. Also, it is close to the greenhouse. Putting it anywhere else would have been far more complicated and resource heavy. Use small and slow solutions <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/glossary-of-terms/#smallandslow\">#Permaculture Principle</a></p>\n<p>There had been some discussion about developing the whole walled garden site. I came up with a rough idea of what could be done and this can be seen below;</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/KitchenGardenSIte.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/KitchenGardenSIte-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/KitchenGardenSIte-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/KitchenGardenSIte-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/KitchenGardenSIte-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/KitchenGardenSIte-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/KitchenGardenSIte-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1557\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>There is the potential to expand the kitchen garden further, at a later date</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkatfn9mi9\">Raised bed layout</h3>\n<p>I had to decide on the layout of the raised beds. I tried a few different configurations that can be seen <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/BedPlacementDecisionProcess.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<p>The layout that I chose is made up of a pattern of seven beds that is repeated twice. If founding doesn't allow, just one set could be built. </p>\n<p>With two sets, there were two areas left to fill where plants could be grown. I decided a herb garden would be a simple element in one of the areas. Herbs will provide a crop and also food and habitat for wildlife, including pollinators. I decided to plant green manures in the other area to suppress weeds and enrich the soil. This could be developed later to grow other plants, perhaps more herbs. </p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkb1pltvni\">Soil Improvement systems placement</h3>\n<p>Having looked a the options I decided that all of the systems would work well on the site, as they all utilised waste that was readily available, and I anticipated that we would need a lot of compost. </p>\n<p>The siting for the systems changed, but the original placement can be seen <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/compostingsite.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkb1pltvnj\">Other decisions</h3>\n<p>I decided to use hazel obelisks and arches to make use of the vertical, for growing crops such as peas, sweet peas and other things. </p>\n<p>I chose two areas for bug hotels. </p>\n<p>I placed the seating area by the greenhouse on an area that is fairly flat and will have a nice view of the raised beds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkb1pltvnk\">The final design</h3>\n<p>Once I had made these decisions, I was able to draw a <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/KitchenGardenDesign - Copy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">design</a>. </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fk2b9b9i1ct\">Implementation</h2>\n<p>How I will achieve the change.</p>\n<p>The costings of the raised beds are shown below:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/2021-11-13-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/2021-11-13-2-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/2021-11-13-2-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/2021-11-13-2-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/2021-11-13-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/2021-11-13-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/2021-11-13-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1438\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/Gantt.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Gantt-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Gantt-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Gantt-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Gantt-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Gantt-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Gantt-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1465\" height=\"604\"></figure>\n<p>I started workplan using a Gantt chart, Because I didn't know if the project was going to go ahead, I decided not to proceed with it.

This design will help me decide what format to use and how to approach it. I have now booked my assessment dates for my portfolio (the IPA and FPA), and this made me realise that I needed to think carefully about how to present this body of work. </p>\n<p>I enjoy looking at other diploma students' design portfolios and I would like to share my own, but would only be happy to do so if my work was of a standard that I was happy with, in  a format that I'm happy with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fk1vkhjjrn\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Goals</span></h2>\n<p>I used SMART goals to pinpoint what I wanted.

Yes, I interviewed myself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fk05hb9p32\">Boundaries</h2>\n<p>Time is a boundary, I don't have time to be faffing - I just need a simple format that each design fits into for presentation. <br><br>The fact that the designs need to be clear and concise, accessible and engaging is a boundary, because it means that I can't ramble. I need to be careful that I don't drift off subject. </p>\n<p>I don't want to spend a lot of money.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fk05hb9p33\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Access to the portfolios of numerous diploma students, via their websites</li>\n<li>PowerPoint</li>\n<li>Word</li>\n<li>Excel</li>\n<li>Miro</li>\n<li>Body of work - designs in various stages of completion</li>\n<li>My partner is a web site technician...</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fk05hb9p34\">Analysis</h2>\n<p>I use Miro for a lot of my design work. It's an online whiteboard platform that is designed to allow teams to collaborate. Boards seem to be able to expand into infinity,  it's a very visual tool, and as m<span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">y thinking is non-linear, it helps me to keep track of my ideas. </span><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">I find it indispensable for designing. Because I love it so much, I wondered if I could use it to present my portfolio.</span></p>\n<p>I did a strengths and weaknesses analysis to get a better picture;</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/2/2021-11-08-7.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/2/responsive/2021-11-08-7-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/2/responsive/2021-11-08-7-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/2/responsive/2021-11-08-7-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/2/responsive/2021-11-08-7-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/2/responsive/2021-11-08-7-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/2/responsive/2021-11-08-7-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1797\" height=\"717\"></figure>\n<p>It was quite clear that a website would be better. I hadn't even considered that my partner could make me a website. That is how fixated I was on using Miro. If anyone wants to get me a Christmas/birthday present, subscription to Miro?

Work out how to present my diploma<br>Yes, I have definitely done this. I have a template for the presentation of each of my designs. The design process worked well to meet this goal as it helped me to see things from different perspectives. It meets my long and short term needs because I now have a website to present my portfolio and I can add a section for my gardening business. I didn't quite keep to the deadline but I'm still pleased with the turnaround.  As you can see, the website is up and running!</p>\n<p>I wanted to have a low carbon website. One option for this was to go with a low carbon website company. However, website designers aim to create a fast, efficient websites to  achieve high performance. Low carbon is a by-product of this. For this reason, I feel that I have met my goal. </p>\n<p>2. Do a speedy design<br>I had given myself a day to complete it, and I did whizz through it, but I had to go back and do a lot of tweaking because I'd missed stuff out. Even though I missed my deadline, it served my need to get a design done quickly, to progress the project. It helped me keep focussed and concise. <br><br>3. Make it visually engaging<br>I will have to wait for feedback, but personally, I like it! <br><br>4. Allow anyone to understand my designs<br>Again, I will have to wait until I get some feedback</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\">Insert charts created with <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv-D0SGjt2dKn6xauzCkaqDmpq65rgSBFBw-hsBhoS0Ki_Hw/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Forms.</a></span></span></p>\n<p>Feedback so far:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>wooof wooof woof, woof wooof. Woof woof woooof.</p>\n<p>- Benji, Jessie's dog</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fk0lmq539c\">Permaculture Principles</h2>\n<p><br><strong>Strategic Principles</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Feed what you want to grow</strong> </p>\n<p>I would like permaculture to grow - hopefully my website will help people to understand what it is, and inspire them to incorporate it into their own lives.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I want to grow the website into a platform for my business, so I'm creating something that will serve my short term and long term goals.</p>\n<p>I also really love techy stuff, and this design process will increase my skill set. </p>\n<p><strong>Use edges</strong></p>\n<p>Clients looking for garden design will also see my permaculture designs, and therefore may learn something about permaculture and want to know more, perhaps even have it used in their gardens.</p>\n<p><strong>Make it beautiful</strong></p>\n<p>I intend to create a visually pleasing and cohesive website. </p>\n<p><strong>Use onsite resources</strong></p>\n<p>Killian! I hadn't thought of enlisting his help, as I usually enjoy building websites myself, but as he offered and I'm short of time, I decided to run with it.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Work Where it Counts</strong> </p>\n<p>Rather than creating a second-rate presentation on Miro, developing the website idea is putting energy where it is most beneficial, and most accessible.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Invest Wisely </strong></p>\n<p>I am investing money into my website, but it is a sound investment as it will also support my business in the future. I am also using my time wisely, because trying to make Miro be something it isn't actually designed for would be a lot of work.</p>\n<p><strong>Be Realistic</strong></p>\n<p>Trying to get Miro to do everything was unrealistic, and also, I need to be realistic about how much time and energy I have for doing this work</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fk1vkhjjro\">Ethics</h2>\n<p><strong>People Care</strong></p>\n<p>Self care; I'm making my diploma journey smoother by creating a well-thought out presentation process, This should mean that I experience as little stress as possible in the run up to completing my portfolio.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth Care</strong></p>\n<p>I intend to have a website that has a low carbon footprint.</p>\n<p><strong>Fair Share</strong></p>\n<p>Sharing designs with people online, widening the understanding of Permaculture.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fk0n2no7e7\">Reflection on the design process</h2>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1iv\">What went well?</h3>\n<p>I genuinely had not considered getting Killian to set up a website for me, even though it may have been obvious to anyone else. Through the process I let go of my fixation with Miro, and with my need to do everything and conceded that I ought to let him help me!</p>\n<p>I'm really pleased with the website, I'm confident that it has met my needs.</p>\n<p>Also, Killian found a way to do it all for free, without adverts! </p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j0\">What was challenging?</h3>\n<p>Choosing the right tools and understanding which elements of the design process fitted into which design step. Analysis still confuses me.</p>\n<p>I did a SWOC analysis but it didn't work, it was too basic a concept so I just did a strengths and weaknesses analysis instead, which was appropriate to the task. That was really useful to see, I am starting to see how the finding the right tool for the right task is important.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j1\">Long term vision and goals</h3>\n<p>I hope to have my full portfolio of ten designs uploaded onto the website in time for my final assessment, which is on the twenty-second of February. </p>\n<p>At that stage, I can begin to develop the website in order to promote my gardening business and to also present the design work that I will do after the accreditation. </p>\n<p>I would like to help other diploma students with their web sites, and by that I mean get Killian to help them with their websites!</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j2\">Next achievable steps</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Get feedback about the site and complete the evaluation</li>\n<li>Share with my tutor for my first assessment</li>\n<li>I hope to have five of my designs completed and uploaded onto the website in time for my interim portfolio assessment, the deadline for this is the first of December, 2021</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
