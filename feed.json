I realised that in rushing ahead with ideas meant that I missed important steps out, steps that would have facilitated deeper thought processes. I went back over things where I could, but it was too late to make changes to the final design. To be fair to myself, the deadline was a tight one and I didn't really have time for much deliberation. Once I have completed the diploma, those processes should be well imbedded into my thought processes so that I use them automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>How this design process has helped me<br></strong>It has helped me to see the process I would follow with sufficient time. Looking back at it now, it has made me think of other opportunities that are on the site, such as water catchment on a big scale, and incorporating rain gardens.</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1iv\"><strong>What went well?<br></strong>I realised that I should have done a client interview. As it would have been like shutting the gate after the horse had bolted, I looked at the goal articulation and defined the functions from this. It was a bit of a bodge job, but it worked just fine. I was pleased that I had come up with a solution...a solution for a problem when looking for a solution for a solution...oh dear, I feel like I'm in the Matrix.</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j0\"><strong>What was challenging?<br></strong>I thought that using a different framework, one that looked a bit simpler, would make the process easier. This wasn't the case. I think that my main difficulty is working out which elements go under which headings, and that is just something that will become clearer as I progress through the diploma. </p>\n<p>There wasn't enough time for prolonged observation</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j1\"><strong>Long term vision and goals<br></strong></p>\n<p>The long term vision is that this kitchen garden is part of a bigger community garden that is able to sustain itself financially.</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j2\"><strong>Next achievable steps</strong></p>\n<p>This project is now on hold, so there are no next achievable steps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/Benji1920.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-xs.jpg 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-sm.jpg 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-md.jpg 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"658\">\n<figcaption >Fauna was difficult to assess, but glimpses of this interesting chap are fairly common</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Work out how to present my diploma<br>Yes, I have definitely done this. I have a template for the presentation of each of my designs. The design process worked well to meet this goal as it helped me to see things from different perspectives. It meets my long and short term needs because I now have a website to present my portfolio and I can add a section for my gardening business. I didn't quite keep to the deadline but I'm still pleased with the turnaround.  As you can see, the website is up and running!</p>\n<p>I wanted to have a low carbon website. One option for this was to go with a low carbon website company. However, website designers aim to create a fast, efficient websites to  achieve high performance. Low carbon is a by-product of this. For this reason, I feel that I have met my goal. </p>\n<p>2. Do a speedy design<br>I had given myself a day to complete it, and I did whizz through it, but I had to go back and do a lot of tweaking because I'd missed stuff out. Even though I missed my deadline, it served my need to get a design done quickly, to progress the project. It helped me keep focussed and concise. <br><br>3. Make it visually engaging<br>I will have to wait for feedback, but personally, I like it! <br><br>4. Allow anyone to understand my designs<br>Again, I will have to wait until I get some feedback</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkfaklbu7c\">Feedback</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I gathered feedback using this</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv-D0SGjt2dKn6xauzCkaqDmpq65rgSBFBw-hsBhoS0Ki_Hw/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Form.</a></span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Please feel free to fill it in if you would like to.</span></span></p>\n<p>The feedback was mostly very positive and there were some excellent suggestions, some of which I have already implemented. Some of the points were things that I have planned to do, but haven't had time to do, mostly suggestions about improving images, adding more images and making the images the appropriate size. </p>\n<p>This was a very interesting part of the design process. I started to understand the limitations of feedback via a Google Forms,  and had to tweak my questions to get a clearer understanding. But now I am evaluating my evaluation process! There is a whole design project in designing a website and another one in gathering feedback.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I found the design clear and precise.

I hadn't thought of enlisting his help, as I usually enjoy building websites myself, but as he offered and I'm short of time, I decided to run with it.<br><strong>Work Where it Counts</strong> <br>Rather than creating a second-rate presentation on Miro, developing the website idea is putting energy where it is most beneficial, and most accessible.<br><strong>Invest Wisely<br></strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">I am investing money into my website, but it is a sound investment as it will also support my business in the future.

That was really useful to see, I am starting to see how the finding the right tool for the right task is important.</p>\n<p><strong>What I learnt about myself through the design process<br></strong>I genuinely had not considered getting Killian to set up a website for me, even though it may have been obvious to anyone else. Through the process I let go of my fixation with Miro, and with my need to do everything and conceded that I ought to let him help me! I have seen that I have blind spots. You may call it stubbornness... </p>\n<p><strong>How this design process has helped me:<br></strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">It has helped me by giving me a place to put all my designs. An unexpected benefit is that it has given me a outlet for my creativity and my love of techy stuff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">I learnt some new skills, such as how to make documents more accessible. </span></p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1iv\"><strong>What went well?<br></strong>I made good use of the tools. Overall, I was pleased with the design process. I didn't have time to go off on tangents and managed to be quite methodical. </p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j0\"><strong>What was challenging?<br></strong>Choosing the right tools and understanding which elements of the design process fitted into which design step. Knowing which elements of the design fit under which heading. I have paralysis about analysis.</p>\n<p>It's also difficult to separate the design process and the design itself</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j1\"><strong>Long term vision and goals<br></strong>I hope to have my full portfolio of ten designs uploaded onto the website in time for my final assessment, which is on the twenty-second of February, 2022. </p>\n<p>At that stage, I can begin to develop the website in order to promote my gardening business and to also present the design work that I will do after the accreditation. </p>\n<p>I would like to help other diploma students with their websites, and by that I mean get Killian to help them with their websites!</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j2\"><strong>Next achievable steps</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get feedback about the site and complete the evaluation</li>\n<li>Share with my tutor for my first assessment</li>\n<li>I hope to have five of my designs completed and uploaded onto the website in time for my interim portfolio assessment, the deadline for this is the first of December, 2021</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Milne, </span><span id=\"quote_book_link_99107\">Winnie-the-Pooh</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So here you are in the place where I have put some Things that were very Thingish inside me. Well, hurrah, they are now out in the open for you to look at. I hope you like them. </p>\n<p>If you feel like letting me know what you think of my new website, you could fill in this form <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv-D0SGjt2dKn6xauzCkaqDmpq65rgSBFBw-hsBhoS0Ki_Hw/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. That would be very helpful and I will be hugely grateful. </p>\n<p> </p>",
