It was leased to Bradford Community Environment Project (BCEP) until they folded and the site was taken on by Bradford Organic Community Services in 2017. I was employed BOCS in 2020 as community gardener. The site has three commercial polytunnels and also a large number of raised beds in the open ground. The key objective of my role was to grow produce.</p>\n<p>I saw the need and possibility of producing compost, to support the fruit and vegetable production.<br>A lot of organic materials are available for use on the site. It would be possible to recycle them and turn them into high quality compost to support the growth of healthy plants. There is potential to create different types of compost for different purposes.<br>The current composting system is not working. It has been neglected and doesn't function effectively. There are many opportunities for composting waste that are being missed.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--full\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/ANEY4821.jpg\" data-size=\"1440x1440\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/ANEY4821-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Beetroot detail on the entrance gate</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/ECNW4382.jpg\" data-size=\"1440x1440\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/ECNW4382-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Spade and flowers detail on the entrance gate</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_5247.JPG\" data-size=\"2448x2448\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_5247-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>The sign at the entrance</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/RAOR3765.jpg\" data-size=\"1440x1440\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/RAOR3765-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>The entrance gate</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/OMNB3651.jpg\" data-size=\"1440x1440\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/OMNB3651-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Gardening fork detail on the entrance gate</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<blockquote>Loam wasn't built in a day\n<p>- unknown</p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/JoSurvey-narrow.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/JoSurvey-narrow-xs.JPG 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/JoSurvey-narrow-sm.JPG 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/JoSurvey-narrow-md.JPG 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/JoSurvey-narrow-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/JoSurvey-narrow-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/JoSurvey-narrow-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1067\">\n<figcaption >Jo, a volunteer, helping with the survey</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bg\">Survey</h2>\n<p>What are the priorities?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To create high quality compost to support food production</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What are the additional things it would be nice to have?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to train staff and volunteers how to use the compost systems</li>\n<li>To run composting workshops for staff, volunteers and visitors</li>\n<li>Food waste collection/donation from local community</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What is the vision for the site?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To be community-sufficient in compost</li>\n<li>To have efficient, low maintenance systems </li>\n<li>To have a straightforward system that processes all waste from the veg production areas</li>\n<li>For the systems to be close to where waste is produced</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There is a small budget available for the overall growing project and some of it can be used for the composting systems.

A wide variety of food crops are grown in these, to be sold to visitors, cafes and shops. The growing media in the beds is depleted as crops have been harvested but they have not been adequately topped up with compost, if at all. The beds need topping up as a matter of urgency. In the first year, it will be necessary to top up with bought-in compost but this is expensive and results in increased carbon emissions. </p>\n<p>Healthy soil means healthy crops that are more resilient to pests and drought. Healthy soil also yields crops with higher nutritional content. </p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bq\">Why a redesign?</h3>\n<p>The current system is not effective because;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The current bays are too far from most of the working areas</li>\n<li>Workers don't know what to put where so they dump everything on The Heap</li>\n<li>The compost bays are not safe as the paths are slippery and there is run-off pooling on the paths </li>\n<li>Grass clippings from the bowling green in the park are being used.

As one function for the systems was 'low maintenance', as a whole the system should be fairly low maintenance.</p>\n<p>I wrote a basic <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Maintenance plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maintenance plan</a>. It is only basic because I did not stay in that job. </p>\n<p>Had I stayed, I would have done a design around communication for how to use the systems. This would have allowed more people to be involved in the maintenance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c0\">Evaluation</h2>\n<p>In-depth evaluation was not possible for this design as it wasn't implemented. But as far as I can tell, if the design had been implemented, the SMART goals would have been achieved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c1\">Tweak</h2>\n<p>Looking back at this design I can imagine that it would have been necessary to build a composting system in the old raised beds area. I chose not to put one there as I wasn't sure how much capacity we needed for the outdoor raised beds waste and I wanted to make sure that the one-turn system had enough material. </p>\n<p>I would hope that we would have found a way to produce ramial wood chip. As the forest garden project was a long way from being implemented and using rwc in vegetable beds can be tricky, it was maybe for the best. </p>\n<p>I suspect that some systems would have performed better and that those may have replaced ones that didn't do as well. But having incorporated a divers range of systems means that the best fit would have become evident over time.</p>\n<p>Availability of inputs may have changed such as if the tree surgeons stopped providing free wood chip or we may have set up a community composting system. Developing systems for these changes would have been necessary</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--full\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_5513.JPG\" data-size=\"3264x2448\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_5513-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Old compost systems in the snow</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_5514.JPG\" data-size=\"3264x2448\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_5514-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>The western side of the site looking to the east</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_5516.JPG\" data-size=\"3264x2448\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_5516-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Old raised bed area in the snow</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_5517.JPG\" data-size=\"3264x2448\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_5517-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>The old raised bed area with the wildlife area in the background</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c2\">Principles</h2>\n<p>In addition to those mentioned in the design decisions video, below are the ways that the principles come into use </p>\n<p><strong>Catch and Store Energy: </strong>By developing systems that collect resources when they are abundant, we can use them in times of need.</p>\n<p>In closing the nutrient loop by gathering organic materials and recycling them into compost, what would have been lost has been put to best use. </p>\n<p><strong>Obtain a Yield: </strong>Ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing.</p>\n<p>This is a key principle for this design. The main yield is compost, and it a invaluable resource for the broader project. The efficiencies integrated into this design will mean that the yield is increased at little cost and with myriad benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Use &amp; value renewable resources &amp; services: </strong>Make the best use of nature’s abundance to reduce our consumptive behaviour and dependence on non-renewable resources.</p>\n<p>Another key principle, the design is energy and resource efficient, using resources that are on site or free. By making our own compost, we are closing the loop, and reducing use of peat, synthetic fertilisers, perlite, plastics and fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>Using salvaged materials where possible to build the compost systems reduces the need for purchasing new materials that have a carbon footprint.</p>\n<p>Using willow and hazel for ramial wood chip  means that a resource that is truly renewable is being put to good use, and as using it actually increases the resource and reduces growth that is problematic, the benefits are numerous.</p>\n<p><strong>Produce no waste: </strong>By valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste.</p>\n<p>By valuing all plant material, including so-called pernicious weeds, nutrients and organic matter are cycled and a yield results. By using coppiced willow (some of which are unwanted), hazel and other trees, something that is otherwise problematic is put to excellent use. In using woodchip in efficient systems, the mycorrhizal process produces highly nutritious compost. </p>\n<p><strong>Integrate rather than segregate: </strong>By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between them and they support each other.</p>\n<p>Choosing the right place for each compost system, in relation to it's use and functions means that they can function all the better and will not be problematic. Placing systems in the correct zones means that they are more likely to be maintained and used effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Use and value diversity: </strong>Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.</p>\n<p>By using a variety of systems, we will produce a variety of composts, with different properties for different uses. We will be supporting a diverse flora and fauna, which in turn will support the wider environment, such as the parks and gardens beyond the site.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c3\">Ethics</h2>\n<p><strong>Earth Care<br></strong>Earth Care is very much at the forefront of this design. The soil of this ex-council nursery has been depleted but can be regenerated through the introduction of large amounts of compost, and the resulting increased biodiversity. The following practices are also in line with Earth Care;</p>\n<ul>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">reducing use of bought in compost </li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">not using peat-based composts</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">using only organic methods (no synthetic fertilisers or herbicides)</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">cycling nutrients effectively</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">providing excellent habitat for microorganisms</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">providing a diverse food source for birds and invertebrates</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">making use of waste materials</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>People Care and Fair Share<br></strong>This design will support the broader project, for which people care and fair share are integral. <strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--full\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/UMUJ1907.jpg\" data-size=\"2220x2220\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/UMUJ1907-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Volunteers working in the old raised beds area</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/BnejiKillian.JPG\" data-size=\"2442x2442\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/BnejiKillian-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Volunteer mulching fruit trees with woodchip</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c4\">Reflection</h2>\n<p>My reflection document can be found <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Compost Reflection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. I'm sorry, I was a bit hyper at the prospect of finishing my fifth design. It means I'm nearly kinda halfway through.</p>\n<p>I would also say that as I did this documentation retrospectively it meant that I saw the project and the design process from a different perspective. I can now see that the way I presented my design ideas to my employers was far from ideal as I used Miro. Presenting in this format is much better and in future I would try to present a completed design. I'd also make sure that planning and design time was included in any job spec.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You made it this far. Thank you very much. You are richly rewarded with a joke;</p>\n<p>Q.

I am happy with them</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I struggle to understand what the difference is between goals, aims and objectives. I think that I have managed to use them correctly in this design.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">As I haven't really addressed the aim about community within the design, this is something I could go back to.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Tools</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I feel as though I am getting better at knowing which tool to use for a task. Creating my own was really cool and it worked well.  Developing the matrix to suit my needs was helpful and I've shared it with other diploma students who have found it helpful.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I do struggle with the concept of a 'river of life' because it seems a bit self-indulgent. However, reflecting on my life was very useful for the design process. </td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I would like to create a diagram that links all the designs up - showing how the connect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Framework</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Having struggled with the Design Web previously, I got to know it better through this design. </td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I struggled to figure out what design aspects went where. I don't know where survey, analysis, design decisions or implementation go. These are required for assessment.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">When I use it again, I will follow the books's advice a bit more closely</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Ethics</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I feel that because of my aspirations, the ethics underpin this design strongly</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I don't like to write too much, so I'm not sure how well I have explained how the ethics affect this design</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I would like to bring the ethics in nearer to the beginning of the design process next time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Principles</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Vision</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I really like this part of the design web. Hopes and dreams may sound wishy-washy, but if we only think small, we will never get anywhere near reaching our potential</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I was hesitant to share my vision, but actually, it is so integral to the design that I couldn't leave it out. And although it's personal, I want to share it, because it is powerful.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I'd like to include this in every design I do. Dream big and then see what can become of those dreams</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Analysis</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">By identifying my needs, I was able to come up with some great solutions. This may seem obvious, but the process made me think things through in a methodical way, highlighting things that I wouldn't have considered. </td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Decisions</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Creating a tool to help me decide which designs/design ideas to include was really helpful.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\"> </td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\"> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Implementation</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I am putting the tools to good use and they are supporting my learning</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Keeping the timeline updated is tricky, because life is fluid - things change! </td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">After my IPA I will reassess the implementation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Reflection</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">The Thinking Hats tool is my new favourite tool. It worked really well as a way of seeing my design through different perspectives. </td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I still find the definition of evaluation and reflection a little unclear, but perhaps that is because I've used the Design Web, and Evaluation isn't an anchor point.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I will use a framework that includes both Reflection and Evaluation so that I can get to grips with the differences.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">Evaluation</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">I like using the Rose, bud, Thorn tool for this, it keeps it concise.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">as above</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%;\">as above</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Tweak</h2>\n<p>I have just hit an impasse with my next design, and I realised that I don't have anything in my ALP about what to do if this happens.

I did one about right livelihood, another about the structure of a large-scale community garden project, a cut flower garden design, two forest gardens and a design for the raised beds area at Wibsey, amongst others. But then when I came to document them, I realised that a lot of them had too many big gaps in, so they didn’t make the grade. This informed the first of my key learnings:</p>\n<p><strong>The importance of being methodical<br></strong>I found that following the framework as closely as possible was helpful, although I did find that moving from one step to another that was out of sequence was necessary at times. This was especially true of times when I was struggling with the sequence and really needed to get the clarity that another step could provide, such as having goals/aims. This also helped when I was confused about just what goes under which heading, i.e. analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools are really awesome<br></strong>But you have to find the right one, and if you can’t find the right one, create a new one that fits the job.</p>\n<p>As a gardener, I know when to use a fork and not a spade. When a saw is better than loppers. But with Permaculture design, sometimes the right tool isn’t completely obvious. I didn’t always know exactly what I was trying to do. So I modified tools. I started using SWOC, and changed it to SW. I used random assembly but modified it so that it also included notes and ideas that related to specific areas.</p>\n<p>As someone who can tend to be a bit too self-critical, I found the reflection tools ‘Roses, Thorns and Buds’ and ‘De Bono’s Six Hats’ were very helpful. They forced my brain to use pathways that it’s not accustomed to, to consider things from different perspectives. How marvellous.</p>\n<p><strong>They’re not You<br></strong>Ok, full disclosure; I’m not actually there yet with this one, but it’s wafting around in my psyche, so I think it’ll manifest at some point…So this is about designing with fixed ideas about how the design should be done, what the client needs and what they should get. The inspiration for this thinking came from a Brenna Quinlan Instagram post and as I read it, I started to hear a little voice (not literally) and a finger gently prodding me (that turned out to be my dog kicking me in his sleep), saying ‘you do that, that’s you that is’. Fair enough, hands up, I am stubborn and a bit too rigid in my thinking. So I’m off to TK Maxx to get myself a whole rainbow of hats. I’ll show that Bono character – six? Better make that ten! HA!<br><br><strong>Good enough is good enough<br></strong>Not usually something I’m particularly good at upholding, but when surveying I think it’s an important one. A lot of time and energy can be saved by really thinking through what is needed. And this is another reason why I think goal setting first is important because otherwise, you might overlook the need to survey some things and survey aspects that you didn’t need to. Going back to do things that you’ve missed off isn’t always possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Presentation is Key<br></strong>Through the documentation process I realised that the way I presented some of my designs to people had a detrimental effect on the projects themselves. My fixation with Miro meant that I didn’t realise that not everyone loved it as much as me. Submitting designs that are only half done is also not helpful as people can’t see how the whole thing fits together. However, when time is short or you’re submitting speculative designs, or not getting paid, it’s hard to give get the balance right. I guess that’s something that comes with experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Meta confusion<br></strong>Ok, so this bakes my noodle massively and it’s going ot be difficult to put into words, so please bear with me.<br>When I’m working on a design, I can start mixing up the actual design work with the design process. And when evaluating or reflecting (and don’t get me started on how the heck to tell those to heckin’ things apart) I can slide into thinking about the process rather than the design and not realise. It’s something that I struggle with but will probably click into place at some point. I hope.</p>\n<p><strong>Other thoughts<br></strong>I wanted to use my diploma to find practical and/or holistic ways to find positive solutions and I feel as though I’ve done this to certain degree. Because they were done retrospectively, I feel as though sometimes they were a bit gappy. Not having implemented the two land designs meant that a lot of learning was missing and I feel that this is evident from the work presented. I would very much like to fill that gap in the final half of my diploma.<br><br><strong>Last thought<br></strong>Having completed my first five designs I am feeling much more confident in my understanding of permaculture design. So much so that I am finding it hard not to get stuck into the next five right away. I'm supposed to be having a breather though so they'll have to wait. Right?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

I've always loved turnips too...Then I heard a bit about it when I was in Australia a couple of years later, but really only started to get interested in it when I did a bit of Wwoofing in 2015. Then I did the introduction workshop and that set the ball rolling.</p>\n<p>Now I want to integrate it into my daily life, work and everything.

Work out how to present my diploma<br>Yes, I have definitely done this. I have a template for the presentation of each of my designs. The design process worked well to meet this goal as it helped me to see things from different perspectives. It meets my long and short term needs because I now have a website to present my portfolio and I can add a section for my gardening business. I didn't quite keep to the deadline but I'm still pleased with the turnaround.  As you can see, the website is up and running!</p>\n<p>I wanted to have a low carbon website. One option for this was to go with a low carbon website company. However, website designers aim to create a fast, efficient websites to  achieve high performance. Low carbon is a by-product of this. For this reason, I feel that I have met my goal. </p>\n<p>2. Do a speedy design<br>I had given myself a day to complete it, and I did whizz through it, but I had to go back and do a lot of tweaking because I'd missed stuff out. Even though I missed my deadline, it served my need to get a design done quickly, to progress the project. It helped me keep focussed and concise. <br><br>3. Make it visually engaging<br>I will have to wait for feedback, but personally, I like it! <br><br>4. Allow anyone to understand my designs<br>Again, I will have to wait until I get some feedback</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkfaklbu7c\">Feedback</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I gathered feedback using this</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfv-D0SGjt2dKn6xauzCkaqDmpq65rgSBFBw-hsBhoS0Ki_Hw/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Form.</a></span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Please feel free to fill it in if you would like to.</span></span></p>\n<p>The feedback was mostly very positive and there were some excellent suggestions, some of which I have already implemented. Some of the points were things that I have planned to do, but haven't had time to do, mostly suggestions about improving images, adding more images and making the images the appropriate size. </p>\n<p>This was a very interesting part of the design process. I started to understand the limitations of feedback via a Google Forms,  and had to tweak my questions to get a clearer understanding. But now I am evaluating my evaluation process! There is a whole design project in designing a website and another one in gathering feedback.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I found the design clear and precise.

I hadn't thought of enlisting his help, as I usually enjoy building websites myself, but as he offered and I'm short of time, I decided to run with it.<br><strong>Work Where it Counts</strong> <br>Rather than creating a second-rate presentation on Miro, developing the website idea is putting energy where it is most beneficial, and most accessible.<br><strong>Invest Wisely<br></strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">I am investing money into my website, but it is a sound investment as it will also support my business in the future. I am also using my time wisely, because trying to make Miro be something it isn't actually designed for would be a lot of work.<br></span><strong style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;\">Be Realistic<br></strong>Trying to get Miro to do everything was unrealistic, and also, I need to be realistic about how much time and energy I have for doing this work</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fk1vkhjjro\">Ethics</h2>\n<p><strong>People Care<br></strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Self care; I'm making my diploma journey smoother by creating a well-thought out presentation process, This should mean that I experience as little stress as possible in the run up to completing my portfolio.<br></span><strong style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;\">Earth Care<br></strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">I intend to have a website that has a low carbon footprint.<br></span><strong style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;\">Fair Share<br></strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Sharing designs with people online, widening the understanding of Permaculture.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fk0n2no7e7\">Reflection on the design process</h2>\n<p><strong>What I learnt about permaculture through the design process<br></strong>I did a SWOC analysis but it didn't work, the subject was too basic a concept so I just did a strengths and weaknesses analysis instead, which was appropriate to the task. That was really useful to see, I am starting to see how the finding the right tool for the right task is important.</p>\n<p><strong>What I learnt about myself through the design process<br></strong>I genuinely had not considered getting Killian to set up a website for me, even though it may have been obvious to anyone else. Through the process I let go of my fixation with Miro, and with my need to do everything and conceded that I ought to let him help me! I have seen that I have blind spots. You may call it stubbornness... </p>\n<p><strong>How this design process has helped me:<br></strong><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">It has helped me by giving me a place to put all my designs. An unexpected benefit is that it has given me a outlet for my creativity and my love of techy stuff. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">I learnt some new skills, such as how to make documents more accessible. </span></p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1iv\"><strong>What went well?<br></strong>I made good use of the tools. Overall, I was pleased with the design process. I didn't have time to go off on tangents and managed to be quite methodical. </p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j0\"><strong>What was challenging?<br></strong>Choosing the right tools and understanding which elements of the design process fitted into which design step. Knowing which elements of the design fit under which heading. I have paralysis about analysis.</p>\n<p>It's also difficult to separate the design process and the design itself</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j1\"><strong>Long term vision and goals<br></strong>I hope to have my full portfolio of ten designs uploaded onto the website in time for my final assessment, which is on the twenty-second of February, 2022. </p>\n<p>At that stage, I can begin to develop the website in order to promote my gardening business and to also present the design work that I will do after the accreditation. </p>\n<p>I would like to help other diploma students with their websites, and by that I mean get Killian to help them with their websites!</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j2\"><strong>Next achievable steps</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get feedback about the site and complete the evaluation</li>\n<li>Share with my tutor for my first assessment</li>\n<li>I hope to have five of my designs completed and uploaded onto the website in time for my interim portfolio assessment, the deadline for this is the first of December, 2021</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>May all beings be happy and peaceful.</p>\n<p> </p>",
