            "content_html": "<p>When I started my diploma, I wanted to know what fitted where; 'is this bit analysis, or is it part of the survey still?', 'is this evaluation, or is it reflection?'. I wanted frameworks that were straightforward, linear. I heeded the caution of some not to jump ahead to coming up with ideas, until you'd done your survey. I couldn't get my head around nonlinear frameworks, didn't know where things fitted. At about design fiveish, I thought I was getting the hang of it. Then somewhere in the swirling, overlapping blur of designs that followed, I happened upon the work of Dan Palmer and his Making Permaculture Stronger podcast. And through that, I stumbled upon the wonderful, unsettling work of Carol Sanford. I started to realise that designing is, without a doubt, nonlinear. I had to accept that what I had learnt so far was a really just a good basis for exploring designs that didn't always, if ever, follow rules.</p>\n<p>It was an uncomfortable place to be and I was miffed. I wrote to Dan Palmer and told him so. I told him I didn't have time for these revelations, I had deadlines! He loved that and encouraged me to languish in the 'bewildering fertility of the void'. He thought perhaps we could do a podcast together and over a few emails, we had the merest hatchings of a plan for a podcast which would start; \"In this episode, I interview a well-intentioned buffoon with more questions than answers\" because that is pretty much how I described myself to him. </p>\n<p>Yes, that well-intentioned buffoon with more questions than answers was me. Little old me. </p>\n<p>Well, sadly, we will never make that podcast because Dan died as I was writing up my final design, which was profoundly influenced by him.</p>\n<p>Dan has been a huge inspiration to me and I would like to dedicate my diploma to him. </p>\n<p>I will continue to be bewildered, to question everything, to explore Living Design Systems and I will listen very, very carefully to Carol Sanford.</p>\n<p>Blessings to you Dan, may you be at peace.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/30/IMG_0915.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0915-xs.jpg 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0915-sm.jpg 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0915-md.jpg 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0915-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0915-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/30/responsive/IMG_0915-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"746\"></figure>\n<p>May all beings be happy and peaceful.</p>\n<p> </p>",

It is home to them and their two teenage sons, as well as Katherine’s parents. They grow a variety of herbs which are processed to make non-alcoholic spirits.</p>\n<p>In addition to the herb business, they have a number of workshops and studios that are rented by local people. Brookside is people-centred, with a commitment to community development, education and creativity.</p>\n<p>The herb growing operations are undertaken by Katherine and a staff member, Bianca, who lives on site.</p>\n<p>The farm has organic certification. It is approximately 6.4 acres in size.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ga9tn93i2bf\">Brookside Needs/Wants</h2>\n<p>We gleaned the following from discussions with members of the Brookside Farm team:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Help with gardening in the kitchen/rose garden</li>\n<li>Help with site maintenance</li>\n<li>Lovely green spaces</li>\n<li>Waste cycling</li>\n<li>Help with planning</li>\n<li>Support with getting things done (e.g. aquaponics)</li>\n<li>Help with growing vegetables</li>\n<li>General horticultural advice</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/IMG_2161.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_2161-xs.JPG 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_2161-sm.JPG 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_2161-md.JPG 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_2161-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_2161-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_2161-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"The herb field\" width=\"3456\" height=\"2304\">\n<figcaption >The herb field, with the ridge and furrow system seen, if only by the shape of the fence!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ga9tn93i2bg\">Current Growing Activities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The ridge and furrow field is currently the primary growing site for herbs used for processing into product</li>\n<li>The hedgerows and shrubs throughout the site are harvested</li>\n<li>The WET system has soft fruit, top fruit and willow for coppicing</li>\n<li>There are some ornamental gardens connected to the house</li>\n<li>There is a large covered growing space with raised beds used for vegetables, herbs and propagation</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/IMG_0497-2.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_0497-2-xs.JPG 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_0497-2-sm.JPG 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_0497-2-md.JPG 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_0497-2-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_0497-2-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/IMG_0497-2-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"Bianca's plan for the herb field\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\">\n<figcaption >Bianca's herb plan for the field</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ga9tn93i2bh\">Provisional Ideas</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--right\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/14657283_494466424012042_214072517633766007_n-5.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/14657283_494466424012042_214072517633766007_n-5-xs.jpg 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/14657283_494466424012042_214072517633766007_n-5-sm.jpg 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/14657283_494466424012042_214072517633766007_n-5-md.jpg 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/14657283_494466424012042_214072517633766007_n-5-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/14657283_494466424012042_214072517633766007_n-5-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/14657283_494466424012042_214072517633766007_n-5-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"Layla in the willow\" width=\"456\" height=\"608\">\n<figcaption >Layla in the willow</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<ul>\n<li>Start small, just growing for the farm.

But then the Regenerative Life and HDM processes revealed how the capacity to grow vegetables was part of a larger system that needed to evolve as a whole. The process of considering whole living systems doesn’t really accommodate setting fixed aims and objectives targeted at fragments of those systems.</p>\n<p>This design has explored two areas;</p>\n<p>1.specifics of crop growing options</p>\n<p>Here we reviewed potential specific outcomes to assess the viability of resource requirements and timelines</p>\n<p>This was limited by the availability of data. The survey would need to be more in-depth if we were to proceed with the implementation.</p>\n<p>2.Resources and infrastructure that can be shared across the whole Brookside project, e.g. composting/chickens etc. inline with their aspirations.</p>\n<p>We considered these thoroughly. What was difficult to get to grips with was the people side of the farm; communication systems, and human resources, what is shared by who and how etc. All of this is still to be determined and this has impacted on our ability to make decisions somewhat.</p>\n<p>We’ve analysed the existing systems and developed an understanding of the whole, which we can then carry into the next iteration of HDM. Although it was tempting to cut and paste that last sentence into the aim section on slide two, the learning we have gained from this process has been invaluable.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/gallery/currants.jpg\" data-size=\"1201x1201\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/gallery/currants-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Currants growing in the WET system</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/gallery/seabuckthorn.jpg\" data-size=\"720x720\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/gallery/seabuckthorn-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Sea Buckthorn growing in the WET system</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/gallery/219260389_646025182189498_1972196625634772316_n-2.jpg\" data-size=\"862x862\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/gallery/219260389_646025182189498_1972196625634772316_n-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Foraged finds</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1gagk84b035a\">Implementation for this design</h2>\n<p><br>In order to implement this design, we will share it with the Brookside team, and use it as a starting point for further explorations, using the Holistic Decision Making process that we started together recently.</p>\n<p>We need to come up with a strategy for communicating some of the ideas that underpin the process that we’re asking the client to embark on.</p>\n<p>We may need to separate out the theory and the practice and facilitate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A presentation to share the ideas and principles involved</li>\n<li>A workshop to apply those to the context of the farm</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1gagk84b035b\">Reflection</h2>\n<p>You can read my reflection document <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/GBReflectionSlides.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Well, that's it folks.

It was very personal, so I'm not sharing it in full, but here are a few little snippets.</p>\n<p>The design was very useful  as a support for a difficult situation. It provided a framework for making decisions and it was a bit of emergency Permaculture at times! I learned a lot about myself and it helped me think deeply about what I am willing to tolerate, and the strength of one's desires to blind you to the truth of a situation.</p>\n<p>It was a good step towards designing collaboratively with my partner. We worked together on two of my other designs that followed after this one.  </p>\n<p>The best tool I used was the Circle of Control. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘When we spend our time acting in the wider circle of concern, worrying, generating fear and playing out disaster scenarios of what could happen, we use up available energy that could be spent in our circle of influence. Our circle of influence shrinks as a result of lack of attention and energy and also because the energy spent in worrying disempowers us.</p>\n<p>In contrast, when our energy is spent in our circle of influence it expands and we become able to tackle some of the issues that were previously out of reach’</p>\n<p>~Looby Macnamara</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Below is the diagram that I created to visualise my Circle of Control;</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/25/2022-08-04.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/25/responsive/2022-08-04-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/25/responsive/2022-08-04-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/25/responsive/2022-08-04-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/25/responsive/2022-08-04-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/25/responsive/2022-08-04-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/25/responsive/2022-08-04-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></figure>",

Hilarious, given that within a year I’d be in a cult, and wouldn’t leave for another six years!</p>\n<p>Well, I am asking myself where I’d like to be in five years’ time now. In 10 years’ time, I’d like to be living on the land, with some good folk, fellow guardians of the land. I’d like to be shit-hot at growing food and be skilled in other practical stuff – preserving, cooking, foraging etc. I’d like to have zero carbon footprint. In five years’ time, I’d like to be well on my way to being skilled up. And I’d like to be ridiculously happy. Actually, the latter is the most important…</p>\n<p>I would like to do a design that is about how to earn money/get by, perhaps on a system that is not about money…How about being community sufficient? I would like to live in close harmony with the land. At the moment, I live in a second floor flat in Baildon, on the edge of Shipley. It is very much an urban situation. It's quite a far call from where I'd like to be, but **INSERT PRINCIPLE HERE!**</p>\n<p>I feel anxious about this endeavour, as though I need to be out there already, learning. I am worried that I should be getting on with looking for a placement…but I am here, now. Perhaps it would be good to enjoy a year working on my diploma, get a part time job, enjoy the allotment, wait for Covid to pass – if it will…sit out the storm. As Burgs said, now is not the time to be venturing forth into new things…chill, make a full recovery from the frozen shoulder and use the time wisely. Get fit again. Look at the list of skills I’d like to acquire and see if I can do any from where I am now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In re-writing it, I felt that I wanted to change the framework, as it's an ongoing design. </p>\n<p> </p>",
