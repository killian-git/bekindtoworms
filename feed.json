It's been very challenging, because I thought I'd be learning about how to make maps, how to use ...  and I have learnt a lot of that, but what I've learnt most is that it's the people stuff that matters most. I've seen it done badly. Really badly. And I don't want to replicate that. </p>\n<p>Resilience. </p>\n<p>I used the forum to share my Community Gardens People design, but I didn't hace time to heed their advice. I then duly forgot about it, as I hadn't done the reflection - probably due to aversion to looking at the project any more, and then got drawn into the whole Hellbent story, where all those things would have served me very nicely. I got back into my pattern!  </p>\n<p>I realised during the CG design that I wanted to work collaboratively on future designs, and I have done so on another design.</p>\n<p>Having a body of work to look back on means that I can see very clearly the learning, the patterns, the areas I need to work on in myself, to come to terms with aspects of my character and also, where to set boundaries, and how to make decisions about projects I want to get involved with in the future. I am learning so much about myself.</p>\n<p> </p>",

I’ve got to raise my game as I’ve just been given the go ahead to do my accreditation event at this year’s National Permaculture Gathering. Yoiks! So, to keep up the momentum, I’m going to do a 100 day challenge. I’ll be posting every day, until the event. There’s more than 100 days but I’m off on retreat, but I can still fit in 100).</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Luckily, I’m at a lovely farm @Brookside.eco.farm where Permaculture is very much embraced, and it looks as though we might be staying! I’ll be doing at least one design for them, there’s lots of exciting stuff happening!</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">These pictures are of the incredible WET system they had installed. It cleans all the grey and brown water from the main buildings, as it passes through five ponds. The water is cleaned by diverse range of trees and perennials, many of which provide food or other uses. By the fifth pond, it’s clean enough to swim in!</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Not only that, walking through it is heavenly.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Also, Benji has become a reluctant member of a pack of four dogs, this is Trewa. It was quite a challenge to get a shot of them together.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Today I finished the amendments for my first five designs. I’m taking on a big challenge, but I’m going to give it everything I’ve got. I hope you’ll enjoy following my progress-wish me luck!!</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><a class=\"oajrlxb2 g5ia77u1 qu0x051f esr5mh6w e9989ue4 r7d6kgcz rq0escxv nhd2j8a9 nc684nl6 p7hjln8o kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8

I was employed BOCS in 2020 as community gardener. The site has three commercial polytunnels and also a large number of raised beds in the open ground. The key objective of my role was to grow produce.</p>\n<p>I saw the need and possibility of producing compost, to support the fruit and vegetable production.<br>A lot of organic materials are available for use on the site. It would be possible to recycle them and turn them into high quality compost to support the growth of healthy plants.

The growing media in the beds is depleted as crops have been harvested but they have not been adequately topped up with compost, if at all. The beds need topping up as a matter of urgency. In the first year, it will be necessary to top up with bought-in compost but this is expensive and results in increased carbon emissions. </p>\n<p>Healthy soil means healthy crops that are more resilient to pests and drought.

The main yield is compost, and it a invaluable resource for the broader project. The efficiencies integrated into this design will mean that the yield is increased at little cost and with myriad benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Use &amp; value renewable resources &amp; services: </strong>Make the best use of nature’s abundance to reduce our consumptive behaviour and dependence on non-renewable resources.</p>\n<p>Another key principle, the design is energy and resource efficient, using resources that are on site or free. By making our own compost, we are closing the loop, and reducing use of peat, synthetic fertilisers, perlite, plastics and fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>Using salvaged materials where possible to build the compost systems reduces the need for purchasing new materials that have a carbon footprint.</p>\n<p>Using willow and hazel for ramial wood chip  means that a resource that is truly renewable is being put to good use, and as using it actually increases the resource and reduces growth that is problematic, the benefits are numerous.</p>\n<p><strong>Produce no waste: </strong>By valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste.</p>\n<p>By valuing all plant material, including so-called pernicious weeds, nutrients and organic matter are cycled and a yield results. By using coppiced willow (some of which are unwanted), hazel and other trees, something that is otherwise problematic is put to excellent use. In using woodchip in efficient systems, the mycorrhizal process produces highly nutritious compost. </p>\n<p><strong>Integrate rather than segregate: </strong>By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between them and they support each other.</p>\n<p>Choosing the right place for each compost system, in relation to it's use and functions means that they can function all the better and will not be problematic. Placing systems in the correct zones means that they are more likely to be maintained and used effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Use and value diversity: </strong>Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.</p>\n<p>By using a variety of systems, we will produce a variety of composts, with different properties for different uses. We will be supporting a diverse flora and fauna, which in turn will support the wider environment, such as the parks and gardens beyond the site.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c3\">Ethics</h2>\n<p><strong>Earth Care<br></strong>Earth Care is very much at the forefront of this design. The soil of this ex-council nursery has been depleted but can be regenerated through the introduction of large amounts of compost, and the resulting increased biodiversity. The following practices are also in line with Earth Care;</p>\n<ul>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">reducing use of bought in compost </li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">not using peat-based composts</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">using only organic methods (no synthetic fertilisers or herbicides)</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">cycling nutrients effectively</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">providing excellent habitat for microorganisms</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">providing a diverse food source for birds and invertebrates</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">making use of waste materials</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>People Care and Fair Share<br></strong>This design will support the broader project, for which people care and fair share are integral. <strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--full\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/UMUJ1907.jpg\" data-size=\"2220x2220\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/UMUJ1907-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Volunteers working in the old raised beds area</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/BnejiKillian.JPG\" data-size=\"2442x2442\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/BnejiKillian-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Volunteer mulching fruit trees with woodchip</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c4\">Reflection</h2>\n<p>My reflection document can be found <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Compost Reflection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. I'm sorry, I was a bit hyper at the prospect of finishing my fifth design. It means I'm nearly kinda halfway through.</p>\n<p>I would also say that as I did this documentation retrospectively it meant that I saw the project and the design process from a different perspective. I can now see that the way I presented my design ideas to my employers was far from ideal as I used Miro. Presenting in this format is much better and in future I would try to present a completed design. I'd also make sure that planning and design time was included in any job spec.</p>\n<p>My tutor wanted me to write something about why I think the solutions fit the goals well. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>make enough compost to meet needs on site to be community sufficient <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">I don't know if this sufficient compost would have been made, but this would have been assessed after a couple of years and the production could have been ramped up! </span></li>\n<li>close the loop of organic material being wasted/processed inefficiently <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">This would certainly have been achieved</span></li>\n<li>create low maintenance systems <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If the designs were followed, using the same materials I'd chosen, then they would have lasted a good long time and remained fairly low maintenance</span></li>\n<li>make sure that weeds are composted effectively so that weed seed and roots are killed in the process <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">The compost systems I chose should have dealt with the weeds effectively</span></li>\n<li>design durable systems - sustainability is met through implementation of ethics <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">I chose materials that would last as long possible, so I believe that this goal would have been met. </span></li>\n<li>place systems where they are needed <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">I am happy with where I placed each system, but without seeing them in place, I can't say exactly how effective they were. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">One shortcoming of my design was that I didn't include a plan for roles, how people were involved, and how to train people, so with hindsight, I think that this really should have been included, and put in the implementation plan. In the future, I would definitely do this, rather than just saying I would include it in another design. I think that was a bit of a cop out. Tsk tsk.</span></p>\n<p>You made it this far.

It is a map of my learning intentions/aspirations and an exploration into why I am doing the diploma and what I hope to gain from it.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fkfls6sfaf\">Vision</h2>\n<p><strong>Allow yourself to dream and create goals<br></strong></p>\n<p>I used this anchor point to think about what I hoped to gain from doing the diploma and also more broadly about how I want to live my life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkubjiie4al\">The Give Back Generation</h3>\n<p>I have been resistant to putting this into the world, because it may seem a bit worthy, but it really is at the core of my diploma and my life. Permaculture to me is Buddhist practice put into practice! It's about Earth Care, People Care and Fair share, all ethics that fit within the teachings of the Buddha, but with Permaculture they have practical application. The Give Back Generation is about recognising that you already have enough, and that it's time to give back. My teacher Burgs explains it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6efbgmPEmk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here.</a></p>\n<p>I wrote a timeline of my life, and then used this to create a 'river of life' drawing'. Sounds a bit hippy to me but it's a real permaculture tradition. I did enjoy seeing the representation of my life on paper. It is too personal to share here, and the past is the past. Suffice to say, like everyone. I've had my ups and downs. It helped me to see the different phases of my life and to see that I am now in a phase where I take responsibility for my own actions and would like to make a conscious effort to shape my life into the best it can be.  'Energy flows where attention goes' and I would like to use my diploma to channel my attention into the things that really matter, to put some really good bends in the river and manage any upcoming rapids so that they don't capsize me. That's enough of that metaphor. </p>\n<p>To get an idea of where I am at now, have a look at my <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/permaculture-cv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Permaculture CV.</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkubjiie4am\">Values</h3>\n<p>I did an exercise on identifying ones personal values, as part of a <a href=\"https://www.richardperkins.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Richard Perkins</a> course. <br>The completed from is <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Personal Values Clarification Exercise.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> but to summarise, the ten values that scored the highest are shown below;</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/2021-11-15-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"word cloud of values\" width=\"1356\" height=\"844\"></figure>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkubjiie4an\">Aspirations</h3>\n<p>I have given some thought to how I want to live my life.

Portfolio Presentation<br>This facilitates the presentation and creation of my permaculture diploma so indirectly, it meets all of my aspirations. It directly meets my aspiration to nurture creativity and to give back. And it did make me very happy!</p>\n<p>Design 2. Kitchen Garden <br>My aspiration to develop my connection with nature is met by this design. The process nurtured my creativity and had it been implemented, would have helped me meet the others. Funnily enough, the process did help me 'let go of that which doesn't serve me', because I realised that the project wasn't for me and I needed to walk away from it.</p>\n<p>Design 3. Action Learning Pathway<br>As per my first design, this one supports all of my aspirations, rather than meeting them directly. The aspiration to nurture creativity was met directly though.</p>\n<p>Design 4. Being Well<br>'Letting go of that which doesn't serve me' was the main focus of this design. developing my connection to nature was an important factor too and my other aspirations were supported by it indirectly.</p>\n<p>Design 5. Compost<br>The key aspiration for this design was to 'give back'. Giving back to the soil, regenerating soil life and soil structure - this is very important to me and it's important to remember that giving back isn't just about helping humans.<br><br>Although none of the designs will directly meet all of my aspirations, they should all meet at least one of them, support them all indirectly and definitely not hinder them in any way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1foq7aitk6r\">Tweak</h2>\n<p>I have just hit an impasse with my next design, and I realised that I don't have anything in my ALP about what to do if this happens. I would like to make a flowchart so that I have a process for this situation, to avoid having a big delay and getting behind schedule.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--right\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/Miriam-Margolyes-002.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/Miriam-Margolyes-002-xs.jpg 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/Miriam-Margolyes-002-sm.jpg 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/Miriam-Margolyes-002-md.jpg 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/Miriam-Margolyes-002-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/Miriam-Margolyes-002-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/Miriam-Margolyes-002-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"Miriam with a fish\" width=\"720\" height=\"1080\"></figure>\n<p>I will return to this design throughout the process of creating my final five designs, so there may well be a ALP part two!</p>\n<p>Here's a picture of one of my heroes, Miriam Margolyes.

I realised that in rushing ahead with ideas meant that I missed important steps out, steps that would have facilitated deeper thought processes. I went back over things where I could, but it was too late to make changes to the final design. To be fair to myself, the deadline was a tight one and I didn't really have time for much deliberation. Once I have completed the diploma, those processes should be well imbedded into my thought processes so that I use them automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>How this design process has helped me<br></strong>It has helped me to see the process I would follow with sufficient time. Looking back at it now, it has made me think of other opportunities that are on the site, such as water catchment on a big scale, and incorporating rain gardens.</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1iv\"><strong>What went well?<br></strong>I realised that I should have done a client interview. As it would have been like shutting the gate after the horse had bolted, I looked at the goal articulation and defined the functions from this. It was a bit of a bodge job, but it worked just fine. I was pleased that I had come up with a solution...a solution for a problem when looking for a solution for a solution...oh dear, I feel like I'm in the Matrix.</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j0\"><strong>What was challenging?<br></strong>I thought that using a different framework, one that looked a bit simpler, would make the process easier. This wasn't the case. I think that my main difficulty is working out which elements go under which headings, and that is just something that will become clearer as I progress through the diploma. </p>\n<p>There wasn't enough time for prolonged observation</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j1\"><strong>Long term vision and goals<br></strong></p>\n<p>The long term vision is that this kitchen garden is part of a bigger community garden that is able to sustain itself financially.</p>\n<p id=\"mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j2\"><strong>Next achievable steps</strong></p>\n<p>This project is now on hold, so there are no next achievable steps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>ROSE -</strong> Signifies a success.

If it's the case that a truly resilient design has systems and elements that serve more than one function, this isn't a resilient design. But also, I think that there may be functions that have not been identified or included, so some of the systems and elements are actually doing more than I am giving them credit for. How can it be that everything has to serve three functions? Does this mean that some elements should be excluded?  I would like to explore this in my future design work.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/Benji1920.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-xs.jpg 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-sm.jpg 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-md.jpg 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"658\">\n<figcaption >Fauna was difficult to assess, but glimpses of this interesting chap are fairly common</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>May all beings be happy and peaceful.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>This is the place where I take an overview of my design work and summarise my thoughts on the process. I will identify and discuss the key things that I've learnt, looking at how the designs influenced my learning and each other. I'll go through the most significant realisations I had about the various tools, frameworks and resources that I used.</p>\n<h2>Midpoint reflection</h2>\n<p>Although officially I started in 2018, that year was completely taken up with the studentship I did with the RHS. Having said that, I didn’t really start work on it properly until 2020, when I joined the guild. The job at Wibsey (where I did the compost design) also spurred me on - the real need for practical solutions was a boon to my motivation.</p>\n<p>I did lots of designs, or at least the bare bones of several designs that didn’t make it into the portfolio. They were an important part of my learning process. I did one about right livelihood, another about the structure of a large-scale community garden project, a cut flower garden design, two forest gardens and a design for the raised beds area at Wibsey, amongst others. But then when I came to document them, I realised that a lot of them had too many big gaps in, so they didn’t make the grade. This informed the first of my key learnings:</p>\n<p><strong>The importance of being methodical<br></strong>I found that following the framework as closely as possible was helpful, although I did find that moving from one step to another that was out of sequence was necessary at times. This was especially true of times when I was struggling with the sequence and really needed to get the clarity that another step could provide, such as having goals/aims. This also helped when I was confused about just what goes under which heading, i.e. analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>Tools are really awesome<br></strong>But you have to find the right one, and if you can’t find the right one, create a new one that fits the job.</p>\n<p>As a gardener, I know when to use a fork and not a spade. When a saw is better than loppers. But with Permaculture design, sometimes the right tool isn’t completely obvious. I didn’t always know exactly what I was trying to do. So I modified tools. I started using SWOC, and changed it to SW. I used random assembly but modified it so that it also included notes and ideas that related to specific areas.</p>\n<p>As someone who can tend to be a bit too self-critical, I found the reflection tools ‘Roses, Thorns and Buds’ and ‘De Bono’s Six Hats’ were very helpful. They forced my brain to use pathways that it’s not accustomed to, to consider things from different perspectives. How marvellous.</p>\n<p><strong>They’re not You<br></strong>Ok, full disclosure; I’m not actually there yet with this one, but it’s wafting around in my psyche, so I think it’ll manifest at some point…So this is about designing with fixed ideas about how the design should be done, what the client needs and what they should get. The inspiration for this thinking came from a Brenna Quinlan Instagram post and as I read it, I started to hear a little voice (not literally) and a finger gently prodding me (that turned out to be my dog kicking me in his sleep), saying ‘you do that, that’s you that is’. Fair enough, hands up, I am stubborn and a bit too rigid in my thinking. So I’m off to TK Maxx to get myself a whole rainbow of hats. I’ll show that Bono character – six? Better make that ten! HA!<br><br><strong>Good enough is good enough<br></strong>Not usually something I’m particularly good at upholding, but when surveying I think it’s an important one. A lot of time and energy can be saved by really thinking through what is needed. And this is another reason why I think goal setting first is important because otherwise, you might overlook the need to survey some things and survey aspects that you didn’t need to. Going back to do things that you’ve missed off isn’t always possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Presentation is Key<br></strong>Through the documentation process I realised that the way I presented some of my designs to people had a detrimental effect on the projects themselves. My fixation with Miro meant that I didn’t realise that not everyone loved it as much as me. Submitting designs that are only half done is also not helpful as people can’t see how the whole thing fits together. However, when time is short or you’re submitting speculative designs, or not getting paid, it’s hard to give get the balance right. I guess that’s something that comes with experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Meta confusion<br></strong>Ok, so this bakes my noodle massively and it’s going ot be difficult to put into words, so please bear with me.<br>When I’m working on a design, I can start mixing up the actual design work with the design process. And when evaluating or reflecting (and don’t get me started on how the heck to tell those to heckin’ things apart) I can slide into thinking about the process rather than the design and not realise. It’s something that I struggle with but will probably click into place at some point. I hope.</p>\n<p><strong>Other thoughts<br></strong>I wanted to use my diploma to find practical and/or holistic ways to find positive solutions and I feel as though I’ve done this to certain degree. Because they were done retrospectively, I feel as though sometimes they were a bit gappy. Not having implemented the two land designs meant that a lot of learning was missing and I feel that this is evident from the work presented. I would very much like to fill that gap in the final half of my diploma.<br><br><strong>Last thought<br></strong>Having completed my first five designs I am feeling much more confident in my understanding of permaculture design. So much so that I am finding it hard not to get stuck into the next five right away. I'm supposed to be having a breather though so they'll have to wait. Right?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
