Hilarious, given that within a year I’d be in a cult, and wouldn’t leave for another six years!</p>\n<p>Well, I am asking myself where I’d like to be in five years’ time now. In 10 years’ time, I’d like to be living on the land, with some good folk, fellow guardians of the land. I’d like to be shit-hot at growing food and be skilled in other practical stuff – preserving, cooking, foraging etc. I’d like to have zero carbon footprint. In five years’ time, I’d like to be well on my way to being skilled up. And I’d like to be ridiculously happy. Actually, the latter is the most important…</p>\n<p>I would like to do a design that is about how to earn money/get by, perhaps on a system that is not about money…How about being community sufficient? I would like to live in close harmony with the land. At the moment, I live in a second floor flat in Baildon, on the edge of Shipley. It is very much an urban situation. It's quite a far call from where I'd like to be, but **INSERT PRINCIPLE HERE!**</p>\n<p>I feel anxious about this endeavour, as though I need to be out there already, learning. I am worried that I should be getting on with looking for a placement…but I am here, now. Perhaps it would be good to enjoy a year working on my diploma, get a part time job, enjoy the allotment, wait for Covid to pass – if it will…sit out the storm. As Burgs said, now is not the time to be venturing forth into new things…chill, make a full recovery from the frozen shoulder and use the time wisely. Get fit again. Look at the list of skills I’d like to acquire and see if I can do any from where I am now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In re-writing it, I felt that I wanted to change the framework, as it's an ongoing design. </p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Building Resilience; Uncertainty in Uncertain Times</strong></p>\n<p>I have heard people say that Permaculture is not good at helping people to make decisions. That has not been my experience. But then again, I do make some 'bad' decisions. I have learnt more from my mistakes than from my successes, that is for sure, so does it even matter? Permaculture design has helped me make decisions and plans, but mostly, it has provided me with a way of looking at the bigger picture, aligning it with what I value most, and keeping on track with that. </p>\n<p>I started out wanting a straightforward framework that I could follow step-by-step. I wanted a Wikihow on Permaculture design. But it began to dawn on me that designing doesn't really work best like that, for me anyway. We are told that when you begin designing, you must do your survey first - yes, you will come up with ideas, but try not to be drawn into them, until the right time. I don't think that is realistic, and I don't think it is at all necessary. By the time I'd got a bit more than halfway with my ten designs, I realised that trying to fit the process into some regimented system was sapping the creativity from me, and restricting my vision. And then the glorious disruption from Dan Palmer and his friend Carol Sanford took me into what Dan refers to as the 'bewildering fertility of the void'. I applied some of their frameworks and tools in my final designs and realised that as far as I'd come with my learning, I didn't really know anything.</p>\n<p>Designing is (shock horror) messy. Which is why I love Miro so much, because I can store all my disparate thoughts on it and come back to them when the time is right.</p>\n<p>I started my Regenerative Life design in order to create a plan for how I would earn a living whilst remaining true to my aspirations as a Buddhist. I did the design, I had some ideas, we actioned the design, but I still don't know what I'm doing. Ah, the bewildering fertility of the void! </p>\n<p>When I started these studies, I thought I'd be learning how to draw really good maps, how to use a bunyip, how to analyse functions, systems and elements, and all that jazz. And of course, I have done that sort of thing, but more importantly, I've realised my shortcomings with regards to communication, to wanting to be in control, to my own rigid thinking. A resilient mind is an open and flexible mind. </p>\n<p>Not only that, but when I talk about People Care, Earth Care and Fair Share, I have to really care, and be willing to share. Through the various projects that I have worked on, I have seen how the ethics, and the word 'community' are bandied about. Which leads me to...</p>\n<p><strong>Personal, People, Place</strong></p>\n<p>I shared my Community Gardens People design in Carla Moss's <a href=\"https://www.permaculture.org.uk/user/5068/carla-moss/diploma-tutor-profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">forum</a> and received lots of good advice, but I didn't have time to heed their advice. I then duly forgot about it, as I hadn't done the reflection - probably due to aversion to looking at the project any more, and then got drawn into a whole other story, where all that advice would have served me very nicely. I got back into my pattern! It wasn't until I came to writing up the design that I saw how I might have avoided those pitfalls. I did then put some of the advice to use in the next community situation.</p>\n<p>I realised during the Community Gardens design that I wanted to work collaboratively on future designs, so I did with two designs after that. This was particularly successful in my Growing Brookside design, when I collaborated with my partner Killian. Having a different perspective and another brain to work with was a huge benefit. I felt supported, especially as I began to feel overwhelmed by the design, and he learnt a lot about the Permaculture process. </p>\n<p>Having a body of work to look back on means that I can see my learning clearly; the patterns, the areas I need to work on in myself, to come to terms with aspects of my character and also, where to set boundaries, and how to make decisions about projects I want to get involved with in the future. I am learning so much about myself.</p>\n<p>Doing zone 00 stuff is really important, because people work is really challenging, but it's the most crucial part to learn. Without other people, without being able to work with others, to listen and to respond compassionately, there's no point doing any other type of work. A land design will fall apart if the people working on it can't work together. This reminds me of the nested wholes of the Living Systems work - I am nested within a community that is nested within the land, and all three need to be in harmony for all to thrive. </p>\n<p>I probably have more questions now than when I started. Does it really matter if a project doesn't have a plan? Does a Permaculture design really help a project? Is the time invested worthwhile? Afterall, as I stated previously, mistakes are the best way to learn. I suspect that it is better to have a design that doesn't work out than to not have a design at all. Because the number of designs that are implemented exactly according to plans are as rare as hens teeth. </p>\n<p>We can be in the moment when we design, and this allows us to be completely in the moment when we action the design, because we have a well-thought out plan that supports the flow of the project. </p>\n<p>I feel as though the Permaculture diploma has shaped my life, and Permaculture itself has been an excellent tool for this. The Regenerative Life design was in the background throughout, and each design has led me through a learning process - through projects that didn't turn out how I thought they would but that gave me incredible learning, and I think that because I was designing my way through, I was more open to the learning. And it seems as though it has all culminated in design ten, which has been positively received by the clients, and we have found a place to be where we can meet the goals we set in the Regenerative Life design.</p>",

I’ve got to raise my game as I’ve just been given the go ahead to do my accreditation event at this year’s National Permaculture Gathering. Yoiks! So, to keep up the momentum, I’m going to do a 100 day challenge. I’ll be posting every day, until the event. There’s more than 100 days but I’m off on retreat, but I can still fit in 100).</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Luckily, I’m at a lovely farm @Brookside.eco.farm where Permaculture is very much embraced, and it looks as though we might be staying! I’ll be doing at least one design for them, there’s lots of exciting stuff happening!</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">These pictures are of the incredible WET system they had installed. It cleans all the grey and brown water from the main buildings, as it passes through five ponds. The water is cleaned by diverse range of trees and perennials, many of which provide food or other uses. By the fifth pond, it’s clean enough to swim in!</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Not only that, walking through it is heavenly.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Also, Benji has become a reluctant member of a pack of four dogs, this is Trewa. It was quite a challenge to get a shot of them together.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Today I finished the amendments for my first five designs. I’m taking on a big challenge, but I’m going to give it everything I’ve got. I hope you’ll enjoy following my progress-wish me luck!!</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><a class=\"oajrlxb2 g5ia77u1 qu0x051f esr5mh6w e9989ue4 r7d6kgcz rq0escxv nhd2j8a9 nc684nl6 p7hjln8o kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8

It was leased to Bradford Community Environment Project (BCEP) until they folded and the site was taken on by Bradford Organic Community Services in 2017. I was employed BOCS in 2020 as community gardener. The site has three commercial polytunnels and also a large number of raised beds in the open ground. The key objective of my role was to grow produce.</p>\n<p>I saw the need and possibility of producing compost, to support the fruit and vegetable production.<br>A lot of organic materials are available for use on the site. It would be possible to recycle them and turn them into high quality compost to support the growth of healthy plants. There is potential to create different types of compost for different purposes.<br>The current composting system is not working. It has been neglected and doesn't function effectively. There are many opportunities for composting waste that are being missed.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--full\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/ANEY4821.jpg\" data-size=\"1440x1440\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/ANEY4821-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Beetroot detail on the entrance gate</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/ECNW4382.jpg\" data-size=\"1440x1440\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/ECNW4382-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Spade and flowers detail on the entrance gate</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_5247.JPG\" data-size=\"2448x2448\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/IMG_5247-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>The sign at the entrance</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/RAOR3765.jpg\" data-size=\"1440x1440\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/RAOR3765-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>The entrance gate</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/OMNB3651.jpg\" data-size=\"1440x1440\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/OMNB3651-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Gardening fork detail on the entrance gate</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<blockquote>Loam wasn't built in a day\n<p>- unknown</p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/JoSurvey-narrow.JPG\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/JoSurvey-narrow-xs.JPG 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/JoSurvey-narrow-sm.JPG 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/JoSurvey-narrow-md.JPG 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/JoSurvey-narrow-lg.JPG 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/JoSurvey-narrow-xl.JPG 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/JoSurvey-narrow-2xl.JPG 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1067\">\n<figcaption >Jo, a volunteer, helping with the survey</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bg\">Survey</h2>\n<p>What are the priorities?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To create high quality compost to support food production</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What are the additional things it would be nice to have?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to train staff and volunteers how to use the compost systems</li>\n<li>To run composting workshops for staff, volunteers and visitors</li>\n<li>Food waste collection/donation from local community</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What is the vision for the site?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To be community-sufficient in compost</li>\n<li>To have efficient, low maintenance systems </li>\n<li>To have a straightforward system that processes all waste from the veg production areas</li>\n<li>For the systems to be close to where waste is produced</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There is a small budget available for the overall growing project and some of it can be used for the composting systems.

A wide variety of food crops are grown in these, to be sold to visitors, cafes and shops. The growing media in the beds is depleted as crops have been harvested but they have not been adequately topped up with compost, if at all. The beds need topping up as a matter of urgency. In the first year, it will be necessary to top up with bought-in compost but this is expensive and results in increased carbon emissions. </p>\n<p>Healthy soil means healthy crops that are more resilient to pests and drought.

As the forest garden project was a long way from being implemented and using rwc in vegetable beds can be tricky, it was maybe for the best. </p>\n<p>I suspect that some systems would have performed better and that those may have replaced ones that didn't do as well. But having incorporated a divers range of systems means that the best fit would have become evident over time.</p>\n<p>Availability of inputs may have changed such as if the tree surgeons stopped providing free wood chip or we may have set up a community composting system.

The main yield is compost, and it a invaluable resource for the broader project. The efficiencies integrated into this design will mean that the yield is increased at little cost and with myriad benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Use &amp; value renewable resources &amp; services: </strong>Make the best use of nature’s abundance to reduce our consumptive behaviour and dependence on non-renewable resources.</p>\n<p>Another key principle, the design is energy and resource efficient, using resources that are on site or free. By making our own compost, we are closing the loop, and reducing use of peat, synthetic fertilisers, perlite, plastics and fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>Using salvaged materials where possible to build the compost systems reduces the need for purchasing new materials that have a carbon footprint.</p>\n<p>Using willow and hazel for ramial wood chip  means that a resource that is truly renewable is being put to good use, and as using it actually increases the resource and reduces growth that is problematic, the benefits are numerous.</p>\n<p><strong>Produce no waste: </strong>By valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste.</p>\n<p>By valuing all plant material, including so-called pernicious weeds, nutrients and organic matter are cycled and a yield results. By using coppiced willow (some of which are unwanted), hazel and other trees, something that is otherwise problematic is put to excellent use. In using woodchip in efficient systems, the mycorrhizal process produces highly nutritious compost. </p>\n<p><strong>Integrate rather than segregate: </strong>By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between them and they support each other.</p>\n<p>Choosing the right place for each compost system, in relation to it's use and functions means that they can function all the better and will not be problematic. Placing systems in the correct zones means that they are more likely to be maintained and used effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Use and value diversity: </strong>Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.</p>\n<p>By using a variety of systems, we will produce a variety of composts, with different properties for different uses. We will be supporting a diverse flora and fauna, which in turn will support the wider environment, such as the parks and gardens beyond the site.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c3\">Ethics</h2>\n<p><strong>Earth Care<br></strong>Earth Care is very much at the forefront of this design. The soil of this ex-council nursery has been depleted but can be regenerated through the introduction of large amounts of compost, and the resulting increased biodiversity. The following practices are also in line with Earth Care;</p>\n<ul>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">reducing use of bought in compost </li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">not using peat-based composts</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">using only organic methods (no synthetic fertilisers or herbicides)</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">cycling nutrients effectively</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">providing excellent habitat for microorganisms</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">providing a diverse food source for birds and invertebrates</li>\n<li data-list=\"bullet\">making use of waste materials</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>People Care and Fair Share<br></strong>This design will support the broader project, for which people care and fair share are integral. <strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--full\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/UMUJ1907.jpg\" data-size=\"2220x2220\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/UMUJ1907-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Volunteers working in the old raised beds area</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/BnejiKillian.JPG\" data-size=\"2442x2442\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/gallery/BnejiKillian-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Volunteer mulching fruit trees with woodchip</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c4\">Reflection</h2>\n<p>My reflection document can be found <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Compost Reflection.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. I'm sorry, I was a bit hyper at the prospect of finishing my fifth design. It means I'm nearly kinda halfway through.</p>\n<p>I would also say that as I did this documentation retrospectively it meant that I saw the project and the design process from a different perspective. I can now see that the way I presented my design ideas to my employers was far from ideal as I used Miro. Presenting in this format is much better and in future I would try to present a completed design. I'd also make sure that planning and design time was included in any job spec.</p>\n<p>My tutor wanted me to write something about why I think the solutions fit the goals well. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>make enough compost to meet needs on site to be community sufficient <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">I don't know if this sufficient compost would have been made, but this would have been assessed after a couple of years and the production could have been ramped up! </span></li>\n<li>close the loop of organic material being wasted/processed inefficiently <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">This would certainly have been achieved</span></li>\n<li>create low maintenance systems <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">If the designs were followed, using the same materials I'd chosen, then they would have lasted a good long time and remained fairly low maintenance</span></li>\n<li>make sure that weeds are composted effectively so that weed seed and roots are killed in the process <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">The compost systems I chose should have dealt with the weeds effectively</span></li>\n<li>design durable systems - sustainability is met through implementation of ethics <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">I chose materials that would last as long possible, so I believe that this goal would have been met. </span></li>\n<li>place systems where they are needed <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">I am happy with where I placed each system, but without seeing them in place, I can't say exactly how effective they were. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">One shortcoming of my design was that I didn't include a plan for roles, how people were involved, and how to train people, so with hindsight, I think that this really should have been included, and put in the implementation plan. In the future, I would definitely do this, rather than just saying I would include it in another design. I think that was a bit of a cop out. Tsk tsk.</span></p>\n<p>You made it this far.

In order to facilitate this process, I have created an Action Learning Pathway, and this is the design for it. It is a map of my learning intentions/aspirations and an exploration into why I am doing the diploma and what I hope to gain from it.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fkfls6sfaf\">Vision</h2>\n<p><strong>Allow yourself to dream and create goals<br></strong></p>\n<p>I used this anchor point to think about what I hoped to gain from doing the diploma and also more broadly about how I want to live my life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkubjiie4al\">The Give Back Generation</h3>\n<p>I have been resistant to putting this into the world, because it may seem a bit worthy, but it really is at the core of my diploma and my life. Permaculture to me is Buddhist practice put into practice! It's about Earth Care, People Care and Fair share, all ethics that fit within the teachings of the Buddha, but with Permaculture they have practical application. The Give Back Generation is about recognising that you already have enough, and that it's time to give back. My teacher Burgs explains it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6efbgmPEmk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here.</a></p>\n<p>I wrote a timeline of my life, and then used this to create a 'river of life' drawing'. Sounds a bit hippy to me but it's a real permaculture tradition. I did enjoy seeing the representation of my life on paper. It is too personal to share here, and the past is the past. Suffice to say, like everyone. I've had my ups and downs. It helped me to see the different phases of my life and to see that I am now in a phase where I take responsibility for my own actions and would like to make a conscious effort to shape my life into the best it can be.  'Energy flows where attention goes' and I would like to use my diploma to channel my attention into the things that really matter, to put some really good bends in the river and manage any upcoming rapids so that they don't capsize me. That's enough of that metaphor. </p>\n<p>To get an idea of where I am at now, have a look at my <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/permaculture-cv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Permaculture CV.</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkubjiie4am\">Values</h3>\n<p>I did an exercise on identifying ones personal values, as part of a <a href=\"https://www.richardperkins.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Richard Perkins</a> course. <br>The completed from is <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Personal Values Clarification Exercise.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> but to summarise, the ten values that scored the highest are shown below;</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/2021-11-15-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"word cloud of values\" width=\"1356\" height=\"844\"></figure>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkubjiie4an\">Aspirations</h3>\n<p>I have given some thought to how I want to live my life.

I must say that this is something that I find very challenging but I am always drawn to community projects. I hope to find solutions for this aspect of my work. </p>\n<p>I hope to complete my accreditation in August 2022. </p>\n<p>I would like to create a portfolio of designs that help me with my aspirations as a Buddhist.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkfoqf2uqo\">Objectives</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I will create a diverse portfolio of designs</li>\n<li>All my designs will fit in with my aspirations </li>\n<li>I will complete my diploma by August 2022</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1fkg5sapt1q4\">Helps</h2>\n<p><strong>Identify the things that are going to help</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1fkfoqf2vqq\">Internal resources</h3>\n<p>I did a skills audit, using the s<span style=\"color: #000000;\">kills tree tool. Unfortunately, I spilt tea on the document so I'm in two minds as to whether or not to put pictures of them on here. But just to give you an idea, they provided me with a visual representation of my skills set. I could see the gaps, and in the future I could use them to identify which of those gaps I would like to fill. <br>I scored highest in the following areas:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Working precisely with instruments, tools, food</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">'Green fingers', garden skills</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Imagining, inventing, creating, designing</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Funnily enough, I scored zero on the 'analysing, breaking sown into parts' section.

But when wanting perfection becomes a way of procrastinating, the phrase 'good enough is good enough' is useful.</span></li>\n<li>I am non-linear in my thinking so bounce around with different ideas and go off on tangents <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Miro is great for this, I can put all my thoughts in an appropriate place.</span></li>\n<li>When I am determined and motivated, I can chip away at something and stay focussed <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Flow is a lovely state to be in, but difficult to get back into once it's broken.

She's awesome. She has kept me on track, has reminded me to look at criteria etc, pointed me towards other resources/support, and has been an inspiring, balanced and thoughtful guide. She might complain about the length of that sentence. I won't blame her, it's horrendous. </p>\n<p>The guild that I'm, which I like to call the Get Shit Done Club, is just lovely. It's made up of people with integrity, humour, compassion and honesty. They have been a huge support to me in this process. We have shared designs, talked through design processes, challenges and ideas.  We've also shared a lot of laughter. I would not have met these fabulous people if I weren't doing the diploma. </p>\n<p>I am very grateful to Killian who when I met him said that permaculture was just 'herb spirals and wafting about with willow'. Now he wants to study it. He has been a great asset as another pair of eyes, providing insightful observations and ideas. And he was crucial to the <a href=\"https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/portfoliopresentation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Portfolio Presentation</a> design</p>\n<p>I am hugely grateful to the Permaculture Association for hosting this course.

Giving back to the soil, regenerating soil life and soil structure - this is very important to me and it's important to remember that giving back isn't just about helping humans.<br><br>Although none of the designs will directly meet all of my aspirations, they should all meet at least one of them, support them all indirectly and definitely not hinder them in any way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1foq7aitk6r\">Tweak</h2>\n<p>I have just hit an impasse with my next design, and I realised that I don't have anything in my ALP about what to do if this happens.
