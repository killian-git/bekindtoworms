Permaculture to me is Buddhist practice put into practice! It's about Earth Care, People Care and Fair share, all ethics that fit within the teachings of the Buddha, but with Permaculture they have practical application. The Give Back Generation is about recognising that you already have enough, and that it's time to give back. My teacher Burgs explains it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6efbgmPEmk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p><p>I wrote a timeline of my life, and then used this to create a 'river of life' drawing'. Sounds a bit hippy to me but it's a real permaculture tradition. I did enjoy seeing the representation of my life on paper. It is too personal to share here, and the past is the past. Suffice to say, like everyone. I've had my ups and downs. It helped me to see the different phases of my life and to see that I am now in a phase where I take responsibility for my own actions and would like to make a conscious effort to shape my life into the best it can be.  'Energy flows where attention goes' and I would like to use my diploma to channel my attention into the things that really matter, to put some really good bends in the river and manage any upcoming rapids so that they don't capsize me. That's enough of that metaphor. </p><p>To get an idea of where I am at now, have a look at my <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/permaculture-cv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Permaculture CV.</a></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1fkubjiie4am">Values</h3><p>I did an exercise on identifying ones personal values, as part of a <a href="https://www.richardperkins.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Perkins</a> course.<br>The completed from is <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Personal Values Clarification Exercise.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> but to summarise, the ten values that scored the highest are shown below;</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/2021-11-15-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-xs.png 300w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-sm.png 480w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-md.png 768w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-lg.png 1024w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-xl.png 1360w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/2021-11-15-2-2xl.png 1600w" alt="word cloud of values" width="1356" height="844"></figure><h3 id="mcetoc_1fkubjiie4an">Aspirations</h3><p>I have given some thought to how I want to live my life.

She's awesome. She has kept me on track, has reminded me to look at criteria etc, pointed me towards other resources/support, and has been an inspiring, balanced and thoughtful guide. She might complain about the length of that sentence. I won't blame her, it's horrendous. </p><p>The guild that I'm, which I like to call the Get Shit Done Club, is just lovely. It's made up of people with integrity, humour, compassion and honesty. They have been a huge support to me in this process. We have shared designs, talked through design processes, challenges and ideas.  We've also shared a lot of laughter. I would not have met these fabulous people if I weren't doing the diploma. </p><p>I am very grateful to Killian who when I met him said that permaculture was just 'herb spirals and wafting about with willow'. Now he wants to study it. He has been a great asset as another pair of eyes, providing insightful observations and ideas. And he was crucial to the <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/portfoliopresentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portfolio Presentation</a> design</p><p>I am hugely grateful to the Permaculture Association for hosting this course. When are they going to set up a degree in Permaculture?
