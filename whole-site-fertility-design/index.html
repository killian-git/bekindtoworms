It was leased to Bradford Community Environment Project (BCEP) until they folded, and the site was taken on by Bradford Organic Community Services in 2017.<br><br>A lot of organic resources are available for use on the site. It would be possible to recycle them and turn them into high quality compost to support the growth of healthy plants. There is potential to create different types of compost for different purposes.<br>Reducing the reliance on bought in compost reduces the carbon footprint of the project and saves money.<br><br>This design will also assess the current plans for the installation of thirty new raised beds and eight compost bays, calculating the best configuration and provide plan for the implementation.<br>In addition to this, the design will look at options for filling and topping up the new beds and topping up all other beds, both those outside and in the polytunnels.</p><p>The current composting system is not working.
