                <p>The story arc of my diploma may not be obvious to someone reading my designs, but for me, I can really see how I'm learning. It's been very challenging, because I thought I'd be learning about how to make maps, how to use ...  and I have learnt a lot of that, but what I've learnt most is that it's the people stuff that matters most. I've seen it done badly. Really badly. And I don't want to replicate that. </p>
<p>Resilience. </p>
<p>I used the forum to share my Community Gardens People design, but I didn't hace time to heed their advice. I then duly forgot about it, as I hadn't done the reflection - probably due to aversion to looking at the project any more, and then got drawn into the whole Hellbent story, where all those things would have served me very nicely. I got back into my pattern!  </p>
<p>I realised during the CG design that I wanted to work collaboratively on future designs, and I have done so on another design.</p>
<p>Having a body of work to look back on means that I can see very clearly the learning, the patterns, the areas I need to work on in myself, to come to terms with aspects of my character and also, where to set boundaries, and how to make decisions about projects I want to get involved with in the future. I am learning so much about myself.</p>

So it’s been quite challenging as I’ve just wanted to do some more organising, do some more ‘research’ or ‘networking ‘ on Facebook/Instagram. Despite this, I’ve made good progress and have crossed lots of tasks off my to do list. But I still haven’t called my mum, so I’m going to stop work once I’ve posted this.</div>

<p>This is a screenshot of a slide from a design I’m writing up for my diploma. My sixth design. It’s a quote from <a class="notranslate" href="https://www.instagram.com/loobymacnamara/" tabindex="0">@loobymacnamara</a> of <a class="notranslate" href="https://www.instagram.com/applewood_permaculture_centre/" tabindex="0">@applewood_permaculture_centre</a><br>The design is about boundaries and the circle of concern tool was of great use, and I think it’s a great tool for daily life. Looby puts it really well 😊</p>

<h2 dir="auto">Day One 21/05/22</h2>
<div dir="auto">Today was day one of 100 days of Permaculture!!!</div>
<div dir="auto">I’ve been working on my Diploma in Applied Permaculture since 2019, and I’m halfway through. I’ve got to raise my game as I’ve just been given the go ahead to do my accreditation event at this year’s National Permaculture Gathering. Yoiks! So, to keep up the momentum, I’m going to do a 100 day challenge. I’ll be posting every day, until the event. There’s more than 100 days but I’m off on retreat, but I can still fit in 100).</div>
<div dir="auto">Luckily, I’m at a lovely farm @Brookside.eco.farm where Permaculture is very much embraced, and it looks as though we might be staying! I’ll be doing at least one design for them, there’s lots of exciting stuff happening!</div>
<div dir="auto">These pictures are of the incredible WET system they had installed. It cleans all the grey and brown water from the main buildings, as it passes through five ponds. The water is cleaned by diverse range of trees and perennials, many of which provide food or other uses. By the fifth pond, it’s clean enough to swim in!</div>
<div dir="auto">Not only that, walking through it is heavenly.</div>
<div dir="auto">Also, Benji has become a reluctant member of a pack of four dogs, this is Trewa. It was quite a challenge to get a shot of them together.</div>

<td style="width: 689.333px; height: 418px;">
<p>Wibsey Community Gardens is on a 2.5 acre site that was previously the Bradford Council Parks Dept shrub nursery. It was leased to Bradford Community Environment Project (BCEP) until they folded and the site was taken on by Bradford Organic Community Services in 2017. I was employed BOCS in 2020 as community gardener. The site has three commercial polytunnels and also a large number of raised beds in the open ground. The key objective of my role was to grow produce.</p>
<p>I saw the need and possibility of producing compost, to support the fruit and vegetable production.<br>A lot of organic materials are available for use on the site. It would be possible to recycle them and turn them into high quality compost to support the growth of healthy plants. There is potential to create different types of compost for different purposes.<br>The current composting system is not working. It has been neglected and doesn't function effectively. There are many opportunities for composting waste that are being missed.</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1fm2ga2fkr8">Why is compost needed?</h3>
<p>There are 144 raised beds on the site. A wide variety of food crops are grown in these, to be sold to visitors, cafes and shops. The growing media in the beds is depleted as crops have been harvested but they have not been adequately topped up with compost, if at all. The beds need topping up as a matter of urgency. In the first year, it will be necessary to top up with bought-in compost but this is expensive and results in increased carbon emissions. </p>
<p>Healthy soil means healthy crops that are more resilient to pests and drought. Healthy soil also yields crops with higher nutritional content. </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bq">Why a redesign?</h3>
<p>The current system is not effective because;</p>
<ul>
<li>The current bays are too far from most of the working areas</li>
<li>Workers don't know what to put where so they dump everything on The Heap</li>
<li>The compost bays are not safe as the paths are slippery and there is run-off pooling on the paths </li>
<li>Grass clippings from the bowling green in the park are being used. It is likely that these contain chemical treatments such as pesticides and herbicides</li>
<li>The current bays are wooden and are rotting</li>
<li>There are bits of timber lying around, some with nails in</li>
<li>The Heap is now home to nesting birds, foxes and possibly hedgehogs and more</li>
<li>There is very little compost being made on site, and a lot is needed</li>
<li>The volunteer who was maintaining the compost bays could not continue due to the pandemic</li>
<li>Workers have little knowledge about composting</li>
</ul>
<p>What is working well?</p>
<ul>
<li>There are some good paths in place</li>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bh">Climate and landform</h3>
<p>In choosing what to survey, I thought about the design and it's requirements. I wanted to make sure I was only surveying that which was pertinent to the design. For example, there was no point in doing soil tests because nearly all of the growing at this stage is done in raised beds.</p>
<p>Climate does affect composting to a point, but in the climate of West Yorkshire, the effects are negligible.</p>
<p>Rainfall is significant throughout the year.</p>
<p>Prevailing winds are from the west. As the site is on a hill, it is a windy site and the average windspeed is 19 km/h. Gusting speeds can be as high as 90km/h (worldwideweatheronline.com)</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1flejnboo1gk">Zoning<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/Zones_LI.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/Zones_LI-xs.jpg 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/Zones_LI-sm.jpg 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/Zones_LI-md.jpg 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/Zones_LI-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/Zones_LI-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/Zones_LI-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1626" height="948"></figure></h3>
<p>I did a very rough zoning exercise, to think about how the site is used.</p>
<p>Zone 1 is where most activity takes place.</p>
<p>Zone 2 is where quite a lot of activity takes place</p>
<p>Zone 3 is visited sometimes</p>
<p>Zone 4 is is rarely visited</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bi">Sector analysis</h3>
<p>I decided that sector analysis wasn't necessary for this design, it was enough to know which way the prevailing winds came from so that strong winds do not damage any systems put in place.</p>
<p>Flood zones were considered as building a compost system in an area that floods could cause run off pollution and nutrient loss as well as slowing down the composting process.</p>
<p>Frost is not usually an issue when making and using compost as it isn't generally used in winter and systems are adequately covered to protect against the elements.</p>
<p>Drought will not be significant enough to affect the composting systems and use thereof.</p>
<p>Sun mapping is not required.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bj">Water systems</h3>
<p>I have included these in the survey video as some composting systems may require irrigation.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bk">Soil</h3>
<p>The majority of the crops are grown in raised beds, so soil testing would not have been appropriate. There are a large number of beds and they have been topped up with various substrates at different times, so each bed would have had to have been tested, which would not be a sensible use of resources.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bo">Site utilities</h3>
<p>The site has running water and electricity. Polytunnel 3 has an electricity point.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bp">Free or cheap resources</h3>
<p><strong>Organic waste from the site</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>pernicious weeds</li>
<li>other weeds</li>
<li>willow branches</li>
<li>hazel branches</li>
<li>food waste from volunteers and workers</li>
</ul>
<p>The site is within a highly urbanised area, so there are many opportunities for sourcing cheap and free materials such as;</p>
<ul>
<li>woodchip from local arborist</li>
<li>leaves collected by local council</li>
<li>food waste from box scheme when it is up and running </li>
<li>IBCs can be purchased cheaply</li>
<li>Manure from staff's family</li>
<li>Pallets</li>
<li>Cardboard</li>
<li>Old fencing that could be re-purposed</li>
</ul>
<p>One key resource is land - there is plenty of space to install any number of composting systems </p>
<p>The urban location also means that it is relatively easy to take deliveries of other materials, such as building materials.</p>

It serves as an excellent reminder that making compost on site removes the import of peat (often a component in commercial compost mixes). #EarthCare</p>
<p>As willow and hazel increase with modest use, it makes a lot of sense to use them for ramial woodchip. </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5br">Goals</h3>
<p><strong>Needs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>make enough compost to meet needs on site to be community sufficient</li>
<li>close the loop of organic material being wasted/processed inefficiently</li>
<li>create low maintenance systems</li>
<li>make sure that weeds are composted effectively so that weed seed and roots are killed in the process</li>
<li>design durable systems - sustainability is met through implementation of ethics</li>
<li>place systems where they are needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Aims for the future/separate designs</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure workers are safe  - this is part of the clean-up project</li>
<li>provide workers with clear guidance on how to use systems - this is part of communication and training project</li>
<li>ensure future gardeners understand the system - this is part of communication and training project</li>
</ul>
<p>I then converted these into SMART goals, shown below. Each goal is numbered and on a coloured sticky note so you can follow the progression of each goal through the five questions.</p>

<p>I thought about the goals and created <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/minimindmapsGoals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini mind maps</a> of each one. I'm not sure why, or what they do...</p>
<p>I did <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/PlusMinusCompostingSystems.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plus and minus analysis</a> of a variety of systems</p>
<p>Then I looked more in-depth at the <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/CompostingSystems.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systems</a> that seemed like the best fit</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--wide" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/the-heap-area.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/the-heap-area-xs.jpg 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/the-heap-area-sm.jpg 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/the-heap-area-md.jpg 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/the-heap-area-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/the-heap-area-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/the-heap-area-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1920" height="368">

<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bt">Decisions</h2>
<p>The key decisions were about what systems to use and where to put them. </p>
<p>I decided to use a wide variety of systems so that all of the materials on offer could be utilised.  As there was no shortage of space, there was room for a good number of systems.</p>
<p>I made a video in which I explain my design decisions;</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dj_imnJmHgo" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bu">Implementation</h2>
<p>The implementation plan including; a project plan in the form of a Gantt chart, a breakdown of costings, chipper research and implementation of each system can be seen <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Implementation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bv">Maintenance</h2>
<p>To a certain extent, using the systems is a major part of their maintenance. As one function for the systems was 'low maintenance', as a whole the system should be fairly low maintenance.</p>
<p>I wrote a basic <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Maintenance plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintenance plan</a>. It is only basic because I did not stay in that job. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/maintenancePlan.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/maintenancePlan-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/maintenancePlan-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/maintenancePlan-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/maintenancePlan-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/maintenancePlan-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/maintenancePlan-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1436" height="803"></figure>
<p>Had I stayed, I would have done a design around communication for how to use the systems. This would have allowed more people to be involved in the maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c0">Evaluation</h2>
<p>In-depth evaluation was not possible for this design as it wasn't implemented. But as far as I can tell, if the design had been implemented, the SMART goals would have been achieved. <br><br></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c1">Tweak</h2>
<p>Looking back at this design I can imagine that it would have been necessary to build a composting system in the old raised beds area. I chose not to put one there as I wasn't sure how much capacity we needed for the outdoor raised beds waste and I wanted to make sure that the one-turn system had enough material. </p>
<p>I would hope that we would have found a way to produce ramial wood chip. As the forest garden project was a long way from being implemented and using rwc in vegetable beds can be tricky, it was maybe for the best. </p>
<p>I suspect that some systems would have performed better and that those may have replaced ones that didn't do as well. But having incorporated a divers range of systems means that the best fit would have become evident over time.</p>
<p>Availability of inputs may have changed such as if the tree surgeons stopped providing free wood chip or we may have set up a community composting system. Developing systems for these changes would have been necessary</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c2">Principles</h2>
<p>In addition to those mentioned in the design decisions video, below are the ways that the principles come into use </p>
<p><strong>Catch and Store Energy: </strong>By developing systems that collect resources when they are abundant, we can use them in times of need.</p>
<p>In closing the nutrient loop by gathering organic materials and recycling them into compost, what would have been lost has been put to best use. </p>
<p><strong>Obtain a Yield: </strong>Ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing.</p>
<p>This is a key principle for this design. The main yield is compost, and it a invaluable resource for the broader project. The efficiencies integrated into this design will mean that the yield is increased at little cost and with myriad benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Use &amp; value renewable resources &amp; services: </strong>Make the best use of nature’s abundance to reduce our consumptive behaviour and dependence on non-renewable resources.</p>
<p>Another key principle, the design is energy and resource efficient, using resources that are on site or free. By making our own compost, we are closing the loop, and reducing use of peat, synthetic fertilisers, perlite, plastics and fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Using salvaged materials where possible to build the compost systems reduces the need for purchasing new materials that have a carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Using willow and hazel for ramial wood chip  means that a resource that is truly renewable is being put to good use, and as using it actually increases the resource and reduces growth that is problematic, the benefits are numerous.</p>
<p><strong>Produce no waste: </strong>By valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste.</p>
<p>By valuing all plant material, including so-called pernicious weeds, nutrients and organic matter are cycled and a yield results. By using coppiced willow (some of which are unwanted), hazel and other trees, something that is otherwise problematic is put to excellent use. In using woodchip in efficient systems, the mycorrhizal process produces highly nutritious compost. </p>
<p><strong>Integrate rather than segregate: </strong>By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between them and they support each other.</p>
<p>Choosing the right place for each compost system, in relation to it's use and functions means that they can function all the better and will not be problematic. Placing systems in the correct zones means that they are more likely to be maintained and used effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Use and value diversity: </strong>Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.</p>
<p>By using a variety of systems, we will produce a variety of composts, with different properties for different uses. We will be supporting a diverse flora and fauna, which in turn will support the wider environment, such as the parks and gardens beyond the site.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c3">Ethics</h2>
<p><strong>Earth Care<br></strong>Earth Care is very much at the forefront of this design. The soil of this ex-council nursery has been depleted but can be regenerated through the introduction of large amounts of compost, and the resulting increased biodiversity. The following practices are also in line with Earth Care;</p>
<ul>
<li data-list="bullet">reducing use of bought in compost </li>
<li data-list="bullet">not using peat-based composts</li>
<li data-list="bullet">using only organic methods (no synthetic fertilisers or herbicides)</li>
<li data-list="bullet">cycling nutrients effectively</li>
<li data-list="bullet">providing excellent habitat for microorganisms</li>
<li data-list="bullet">providing a diverse food source for birds and invertebrates</li>
<li data-list="bullet">making use of waste materials</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>People Care and Fair Share<br></strong>This design will support the broader project, for which people care and fair share are integral. <strong><br><br></strong></p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c4">Reflection</h2>
<p>My reflection document can be found <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Compost Reflection.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I'm sorry, I was a bit hyper at the prospect of finishing my fifth design. It means I'm nearly kinda halfway through.</p>
<p>I would also say that as I did this documentation retrospectively it meant that I saw the project and the design process from a different perspective. I can now see that the way I presented my design ideas to my employers was far from ideal as I used Miro. Presenting in this format is much better and in future I would try to present a completed design. I'd also make sure that planning and design time was included in any job spec.</p>
<p>My tutor wanted me to write something about why I think the solutions fit the goals well. </p>
<ul>
<li>make enough compost to meet needs on site to be community sufficient <span style="color: #ff00ff;">I don't know if this sufficient compost would have been made, but this would have been assessed after a couple of years and the production could have been ramped up! </span></li>
<li>close the loop of organic material being wasted/processed inefficiently <span style="color: #ff00ff;">This would certainly have been achieved</span></li>
<li>create low maintenance systems <span style="color: #ff00ff;">If the designs were followed, using the same materials I'd chosen, then they would have lasted a good long time and remained fairly low maintenance</span></li>
<li>make sure that weeds are composted effectively so that weed seed and roots are killed in the process <span style="color: #ff00ff;">The compost systems I chose should have dealt with the weeds effectively</span></li>
<li>design durable systems - sustainability is met through implementation of ethics <span style="color: #ff00ff;">I chose materials that would last as long possible, so I believe that this goal would have been met. </span></li>
<li>place systems where they are needed <span style="color: #ff00ff;">I am happy with where I placed each system, but without seeing them in place, I can't say exactly how effective they were. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">One shortcoming of my design was that I didn't include a plan for roles, how people were involved, and how to train people, so with hindsight, I think that this really should have been included, and put in the implementation plan. In the future, I would definitely do this, rather than just saying I would include it in another design. I think that was a bit of a cop out. Tsk tsk.</span></p>
<p>You made it this far. Thank you very much. You are richly rewarded with a joke;</p>

<p>As a means to dealing with various health issues, I decided to create a design that would help me navigate my way through chronic pain, and all consequences of this. I started it in January 2020, when I was suffering from a frozen shoulder. Healing is a slow process. The design has evolved and I have re-worked it where I felt it would help me in my current state of health.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>This design process was a very personal one. I wouldn't want to put anyone through having to read it, other than the assessors - they're getting paid.</p>
<p>So if you're interested, I've whittled it down into a little presentation that you can watch.</p>

<p>For the Diploma in Applied Permaculture Design, I must complete ten designs. In order to facilitate this process, I have created an Action Learning Pathway, and this is the design for it. It is a map of my learning intentions/aspirations and an exploration into why I am doing the diploma and what I hope to gain from it.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkfls6sfaf">Vision</h2>
<p><strong>Allow yourself to dream and create goals<br></strong></p>
<p>I used this anchor point to think about what I hoped to gain from doing the diploma and also more broadly about how I want to live my life.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkubjiie4al">The Give Back Generation</h3>
<p>I have been resistant to putting this into the world, because it may seem a bit worthy, but it really is at the core of my diploma and my life. Permaculture to me is Buddhist practice put into practice! It's about Earth Care, People Care and Fair share, all ethics that fit within the teachings of the Buddha, but with Permaculture they have practical application. The Give Back Generation is about recognising that you already have enough, and that it's time to give back. My teacher Burgs explains it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6efbgmPEmk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
<p>I wrote a timeline of my life, and then used this to create a 'river of life' drawing'. Sounds a bit hippy to me but it's a real permaculture tradition. I did enjoy seeing the representation of my life on paper. It is too personal to share here, and the past is the past. Suffice to say, like everyone. I've had my ups and downs. It helped me to see the different phases of my life and to see that I am now in a phase where I take responsibility for my own actions and would like to make a conscious effort to shape my life into the best it can be.  'Energy flows where attention goes' and I would like to use my diploma to channel my attention into the things that really matter, to put some really good bends in the river and manage any upcoming rapids so that they don't capsize me. That's enough of that metaphor. </p>
<p>To get an idea of where I am at now, have a look at my <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/permaculture-cv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Permaculture CV.</a></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkubjiie4am">Values</h3>
<p>I did an exercise on identifying ones personal values, as part of a <a href="https://www.richardperkins.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Perkins</a> course. <br>The completed from is <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Personal Values Clarification Exercise.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> but to summarise, the ten values that scored the highest are shown below;</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkubjiie4an">Aspirations</h3>
<p>I have given some thought to how I want to live my life. I hope to;</p>
<ul>
<li>live lightly</li>
<li>develop my connection to nature</li>
<li>nurture relationships</li>
<li>let go of that which doesn't serve me</li>
<li>give back</li>
<li>be happy</li>
<li>nurture creativity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkg6vu521qk">Aims</h3>
<p>I would like to finish the diploma with a deep understanding of a wide range of permaculture frameworks, processes, tools and approaches.</p>
<p>I'd like to get to the stage where I can incorporate these into my garden design work, my business, my relationships and all aspects of my life.</p>
<p>I would like to create a portfolio that has a diverse range of applications, such as land stewardship, health and wellbeing, community development etc. However, my main focus will be land stewardship.</p>
<p>Community is often at the heart of permaculture projects. I must say that this is something that I find very challenging but I am always drawn to community projects. I hope to find solutions for this aspect of my work. </p>
<p>I hope to complete my accreditation in August 2022. </p>
<p>I would like to create a portfolio of designs that help me with my aspirations as a Buddhist.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkfoqf2uqo">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>I will create a diverse portfolio of designs</li>
<li>All my designs will fit in with my aspirations </li>
<li>I will complete my diploma by August 2022</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkg5sapt1q4">Helps</h2>
<p><strong>Identify the things that are going to help</strong></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkfoqf2vqq">Internal resources</h3>
<p>I did a skills audit, using the <span style="color: #000000;">Skills tree tool. Unfortunately, I spilt tea on the document so I'm in two minds as to whether or not to put pictures of them on here. But just to give you an idea, they provided me with a visual representation of my skills set. I could see the gaps, and in the future I could use them to identify which of those gaps I would like to fill. <br>I scored highest in the following areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Working precisely with instruments, tools, food</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">'Green fingers', garden skills</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imagining, inventing, creating, designing</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Funnily enough, I scored zero on the 'analysing, breaking sown into parts' section. I think I can revisit the skills tree when I've completed my diploma, as then my analytical skills should be much improved!</span><br><br></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkfoqf2vqr">External resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>Office space</li>
<li>Diploma Forum – weekly/monthly online meetings for six-week blocks – sign up if stuck</li>
<li>Guild – weekly online meetings with a small group of diploma students, sharing designs, check-ins and commitments</li>
<li>Regular tutorials and catch ups with tutor Carla</li>
<li>Bradford Area Permaculture Women group</li>
<li>Diploma Facebook group – I can ask a question for clarification on any point and am pretty much guaranteed an answer.</li>
<li>Supportive partner</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Networks</strong></p>

<address>Created on <a href="https://www.mindomo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mindomo</a></address>
<p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>
<p>By biggest inspirations are nature and the teachings of my meditation teacher <a href="https://theartofmeditation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burgs.</a><br>Specific to permaculture, I gain a lot of inspiration from seeing posts from people on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bekindtoworms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, I follow a lot of permaculture people and hashtags.</p>
<p>I also love attending permaculture events and hearing about other student's design work via forums, the guild I'm part of and accreditation events. I have a small group of friends who live in my area who are into permaculture and they are all very inspiring. I have tried organising in-person meet-ups but it's like herding cats.</p>
<p>I would like to explore the work of <a href="https://www.joannamacy.net/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joanna Macy</a> further.<br><br></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkfoqf2vqs">Limits</h2>
<p><strong>What might block the way, slow me down, or keep it small?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at other people’s designs and feeling inadequate</li>
<li>Getting a job and not having enough time to work on designs</li>
<li>Not looking at things objectively when I get stuck</li>
<li>Having quite a chaotic thought process that takes me off on tangents</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkfoqf2vqv">Patterns</h2>
<p><strong>Identify helpful and unhelpful patterns<br></strong>I haven't indicated which of the following patterns are helpful and which are unhelpful, because they can all be either. The best approach for me is to be aware of these habits and utilise them to my own benefit. <strong><br></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I obsess over details <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Excellent, details are important at times. But when focussing on details becomes a way of procrastinating, a tight deadline prevents me from getting waylaid.</span></li>
<li>I am a perfectionist <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Excellent, perfection is important at times. But when wanting perfection becomes a way of procrastinating, the phrase 'good enough is good enough' is useful.</span></li>
<li>I am non-linear in my thinking so bounce around with different ideas and go off on tangents <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Miro is great for this, I can put all my thoughts in an appropriate place.</span></li>
<li>When I am determined and motivated, I can chip away at something and stay focussed <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Flow is a lovely state to be in, but difficult to get back into once it's broken. I will keep phone on silent and stay off social media when studying. </span></li>
<li>I work well with short deadlines (I rock the lastminute.com method) and structure <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Keep the timeline as a guide but work realistically and with self-compassion</span></li>
<li>I am a visual learner <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Miro! Pinterest! Website! </span></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2018 I completed the RHS Level 3 Diploma in Applied Horticulture with distinction. I also have a BA honours degree. So I know I can study and I know how I study; I leave things to the last moment and then work fixatedly. </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkg4v7c61mj">Ideas</h2>
<p><strong>Gather inspirations</strong></p>
<p>I had lots of ideas, so I made an epic <a href="https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/the-life-of-jessie-d3f48d1cc99c4fd5e20677353d136868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mindmap</a>. </p>
<p>I came up with a lot of design ideas</p>

<p>Then life happened and the list changed. </p>
<p>The list is morphing all the time, but the latest version is as follows;</p>
<ol>
<li>Action Learning Pathway</li>
<li>Portfolio Presentation </li>
<li>Kitchen Garden</li>
<li>Being Well</li>
<li>Community Structure</li>
<li>Whole-site fertility design</li>
<li>Food forest</li>
<li>Bird's garden</li>
<li>Jud &amp; Brian support</li>
<li>Benji</li>
<li>Liking where I live</li>
<li>Fairview Court garden</li>
<li>Gardening business design</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, that's more than ten. </p>
<p>I don't want to fix which designs I'm going to do because as I complete the designs, I will start to see where I need to develop my skills and I can choose designs that serve that need.</p>

<p>All the designs are connected in many ways, some support all of the others, earlier ones support those that follow, as I develop my learning.

<p>Design for catastrophe – what if I have to get a full-time job and can’t find time to do my designs? How do I design for that? Having an ALP gives me a road map through my diploma, so I will already have assessed the risks, challenges etc.</p>
<p>First things first; doing the ALP before doing any more designs is setting a strong foundation for the rest of my diploma. Yay!</p>

<p><strong>People Care</strong> is met because I am designing a life for myself that is fulfilling, healthy and compassionate. As my core aim is to be part of the Give Back Generation, care for other people is integral to the design.</p>
<p><strong>Earth Care </strong>is met because part of being in the Give Back Generation is to tread lightly, to reduce what I take out. Working with a deep connection with nature is integral to this.</p>
<p><strong>Future Care </strong>is met because, as part of the Give Back Generation, I will be taking out less and hopefully having a positive effect on the future of the planet.</p>

<p>I went through the list of ‘areas of application’ and highlighted the ones that were of most interest to me.</p>

<li><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>System development &amp; implementation</strong></span></li>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkg4v7c61mn">Action</h2>
<p><strong>Make a plan for getting it all done</strong></p>
<p>I created an action timeline and included significant dates and the following (and many more items);</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-work old blog to present the portfolio</li>
<li>Use Instagram to document diploma process</li>
<li>Set up reminders in Google calendar</li>
<li>Weekly check-ins with the FB group</li>
<li>Weekly guild meetings</li>
<li>Join forum if needed</li>
<li>Attend diploma Monthly Online Gatherings hosted by the Permaculture Association</li>
<li>Get a buddy </li>
<li>Create a tool that facilitates the decision process for which designs go into final portfolio</li>
<li>Use assessment forms and criteria to make sure that I'm on track</li>
</ul>
<p>The timeline can be seen <span style="color: #ba372a;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pzxJxML-l07zc-fGJ2L5DPVGtJDU7eps/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=117411403296018430536&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a><br><span style="color: #000000;">I kept this very flexible. Marking items as complete is great motivation for me.</span><br></span></p>
<p>I have created a <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KWXsR3EoeN0tlEEF1f1dgabsfwQPbXC_/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=117411403296018430536&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Selection tool</a><br><span style="color: #000000;">I have used this for each design I've considered and will include them in the presentation of each design, so that my thinking behind their inclusion can be seen.</span><br></span></p>
<p>I modified the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FYPoP-SHwikPJGp4n9rRR6MiKC5XVHxq/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=117411403296018430536&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matrix</a> form that was given to me by my tutor. It helps me to keep track of which tools, frameworks, principles etc. I have used, and to see any gaps. This will mean that my learning is diverse. <br>It's a great visual tool and I find it satisfying.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkg5nl341pu">Momentum</h2>
<p><strong>Consider how to keep going</strong></p>
<p>I drew up a draft of this design, with a timeline, and then duly forgot about it. However, over the months I was working on designs and ticking other boxes, such as using networks etc. I just wasn't following the timeline.</p>
<p>Now that I've left it all rather close to the deadline, I have all the momentum I need. This is just how I work. </p>
<p>I have reworked the timeline and I now update it regularly.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to my tutor Carla. She's awesome. She has kept me on track, has reminded me to look at criteria etc, pointed me towards other resources/support, and has been an inspiring, balanced and thoughtful guide. She might complain about the length of that sentence. I won't blame her, it's horrendous. </p>
<p>The guild that I'm, which I like to call the Get Shit Done Club is just lovely. It's made up of people with integrity, humour, compassion and honesty. They have been a huge support to me in this process. We have shared designs, talked through design processes, challenges and ideas.  We've also shared a lot of laughter. I would not have met these fabulous people if I weren't doing the diploma. </p>
<p>I am very grateful to Killian who when I met him said that permaculture was just 'herb spirals and wafting about with willow'. Now he wants to study it. He has been a great asset as another pair of eyes, providing insightful observations and ideas. And he was crucial to the <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/portfoliopresentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portfolio Presentation</a> design</p>
<p>I am hugely grateful to the Permaculture Association for hosting this course. When are they going to set up a degree in Permaculture? That's what I want to know!</p>

<p>Design 1. Portfolio Presentation<br>This facilitates the presentation and creation of my permaculture diploma so indirectly, it meets all of my aspirations. It directly meets my aspiration to nurture creativity and to give back. And it did make me very happy!</p>
<p>Design 2. Kitchen Garden <br>My aspiration to develop my connection with nature is met by this design. The process nurtured my creativity and had it been implemented, would have helped me meet the others. Funnily enough, the process did help me 'let go of that which doesn't serve me', because I realised that the project wasn't for me and I needed to walk away from it.</p>
<p>Design 3. Action Learning Pathway<br>As per my first design, this one supports all of my aspirations, rather than meeting them directly. The aspiration to nurture creativity was met directly though.</p>
<p>Design 4. Being Well<br>'Letting go of that which doesn't serve me' was the main focus of this design. developing my connection to nature was an important factor too and my other aspirations were supported by it indirectly.</p>
<p>Design 5. Compost<br>The key aspiration for this design was to 'give back'. Giving back to the soil, regenerating soil life and soil structure - this is very important to me and it's important to remember that giving back isn't just about helping humans.<br><br>Although none of the designs will directly meet all of my aspirations, they should all meet at least one of them, support them all indirectly and definitely not hinder them in any way.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1foq7aitk6r">Tweak</h2>
<p>I have just hit an impasse with my next design, and I realised that I don't have anything in my ALP about what to do if this happens. I would like to make a flowchart so that I have a process for this situation, to avoid having a big delay and getting behind schedule.</p>

<p>I will return to this design throughout the process of creating my final five designs, so there may well be a ALP part two!</p>
<p>Here's a picture of one of my heroes, Miriam Margolyes. Because why the heck not.</p>
<p>May all beings be happy and peaceful.</p>

<td style="width: 727.333px; height: 418px;">
<p>This design is about creating a functional and accessible kitchen garden to be used by a community for learning, connecting with nature, socialising and having fun</p>
<p>The client wanted to install a kitchen garden that would be the focus for activities for community groups. There is no kitchen for the garden to serve at present. </p>
<p>This was the extent of the brief.  The client left it to me to create a garden that could be part of a sustainable business and part of a bigger project that utilised the gardens on the larger site. </p>
<p>I decided to use this opportunity to create my dream kitchen garden, and one that would be accessible to as many people as possible. I decided to use materials that had the least ecological impact and to include elements that would benefit all aspects of the environment, where possible.</p>
<p>Local consultation was not possible, but I would hope that this would take place at some point, within the design of the larger project. </p>

<p><strong>What I want.</strong></p>
<p>I would like to create a garden that;</p>
<ul>
<li data-list="bullet">produces a wide variety of fruit and vegetables</li>
<li data-list="bullet">increases biodiversity</li>
<li data-list="bullet">provides opportunities for people to learn about and connect with nature/the growing process</li>
<li data-list="bullet">is accessible for everyone and can engage a diverse range of people</li>
<li data-list="bullet">is not only sustainable but also regenerative</li>
<li data-list="bullet">strengthens the local community and is shaped by the local community</li>
<li data-list="bullet">looks beautiful, to inspire and engage</li>
<li data-list="bullet">uses environmentally friendly and organic methods - reducing waste, recycling/reusing. free from pesticides, herbicides, no peat, no dig, less fossil fuels (hand tools rather than power tools)</li>
<li data-list="bullet">uses local resources, especially waste from on site, e.g. woodchip, leaves and grass clippings</li>

<p>I created a mood board on <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/bekindtoworms/dreamtime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest.</a></p>

<p>The survey was not as in-depth as I would have liked, due to the following factors;  I had a very short deadline for completing this design, accessing the site was problematic and the number of people on site to ask for more information was very limited.</p>
<p>You can see all my survey information on this <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lkxaHao=/" target="null">Miro board</a>, but Miro isn't for everyone, so I have included almost everything else below.</p>
<p>I took some photos of the site and mapped them <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lkxaHao=/?moveToWidget=3074457367262826741&amp;cot=14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to indicate viewpoint.<br>The screenshot below gives you an idea, but by clicking on the link above you will be able to zoom in to get a better look.</p>

<p>Due to time constraints, I have only done a very basic sector analysis. I have not made observations myself, but have used general data available on the internet. This is sufficient for the project. </p>
<p>Shade will not affect the design per se, but will influence how crops are grown, but that is not within the remit of this design. </p>
<p>The greenhouse to the east of the raised bed area will cast some shade at times.</p>
<p>The Horse Chestnut to the south of the raised bed area will also cast some shade at times.</p>
<p>The trees to the west, north and east of the site will provide a windbreak, as will the walls that surround the whole site. Again, this is only really relevant to the growing of crops.</p>
<p>The site is fairly exposed, especially as a large number of very tall conifers have recently been cut down. These used to surround the kitchen garden site. Further developments of the site, such as the creation of a forest garden, may well provide protection. </p>
<p>The site is on private land with security gates and at present there is no access to the public. This may change, depending on what happens to the site.<br><br>The hall is a Grade II listed building. The walls of the walled garden are included in this. They have fallen into disrepair but will be refurbished in 2022</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fk2b9b9i1cs">Decision Making</h2>
<p><strong>What I need to change.</strong></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkatfn9mi8">Kitchen garden placement</h3>
<p>The decision of where to place the kitchen garden was straightforward. The area next to the greenhouse previously had raised beds, so some paths are already in place. Also, it is close to the greenhouse. Putting it anywhere else would have been far more complicated and resource heavy. <span style="color: #ba372a;"><a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/glossary-of-terms/#smallandslowsolutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#smallandslowsolutions</a></span> <span style="color: #ba372a;"><a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/glossary-of-terms/#patternstodetails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#patternstodetails</a></span></p>
<p>There had been some discussion about developing the whole walled garden site. I came up with a rough idea of what could be done and this can be seen below;</p>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/KitchenGardenSIte.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/KitchenGardenSIte-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/KitchenGardenSIte-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/KitchenGardenSIte-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/KitchenGardenSIte-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/KitchenGardenSIte-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/KitchenGardenSIte-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1557" height="1080">
<figcaption >Initial ideas for various elements for whole site</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is the potential to expand the kitchen garden further, at a later date</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkatfn9mi9">Raised bed layout</h3>
<p>I had to decide on the layout of the raised beds, using the dimensions defined by my accessibility research. I tried a few different configurations that can be seen <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/BedPlacementDecisionProcess.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<p>The layout that I chose is made up of a pattern of seven beds that is repeated twice. If funding doesn't allow, just one set could be built. </p>
<p>With two sets, there were two areas left to fill where plants could be grown. I decided a herb garden would be a simple element in one of the areas. Herbs will provide a crop and also food and habitat for wildlife, including pollinators. <span style="color: #ba372a;"><a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/glossary-of-terms/#obtainayield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Obtain a yield</a></span> I decided to plant green manures in the other area to suppress weeds and enrich the soil. This could be developed later to grow other plants, perhaps more herbs. </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkb1pltvni">Soil Improvement systems placement</h3>
<p>Having looked a the options I decided that all of the systems would work well on the site, as they all utilised waste that was readily available, and I anticipated that we would need a lot of compost. </p>
<p>The siting for the systems changed, but the original placement can be seen <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/compostingsite.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>When I came to drawing up the design, I realised that there was a better place for the composting systems, near the greenhouse door where a path already exists - this would make the composting system accessible straight away.<span style="color: #ba372a;"> <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#integrateratherthansegregate</a></span></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkb1pltvnj">Other decisions</h3>
<p>I decided to use hazel obelisks and arches to make use of the vertical, for growing crops such as peas, sweet peas, etc.  </p>
<p>I chose two areas for bug hotels. <span style="color: #ba372a;"><a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/glossary-of-terms/#obtainayield" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#obtainayield </a></span></p>
<p>I placed the seating area by the greenhouse on an area that is fairly flat and will have a nice view of the raised beds.</p>
<p>The gutters of the greenhouse are quite low down, so small water butts will be installed to collect water.</p>
<p>The tap shown on the basemap is the only source of irrigation, so a hose system will be set up from this.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkb1pltvnk">The final design</h3>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center">Once I had made these decisions, I was able to draw a design.  <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/KitchenGardenDesign - Copy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here </a>to see a bigger version. <br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/finaldesignscreenshot.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/finaldesignscreenshot-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/finaldesignscreenshot-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/finaldesignscreenshot-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/finaldesignscreenshot-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/finaldesignscreenshot-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/finaldesignscreenshot-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1070" height="750"></figure>

<p><strong>How I will continue to manage and maintain this project.</strong></p>
<p>The project is now on hold. </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkq1uvp63ta">Evaluate</h2>
<p>were your project aims met through the design solution you created? Was the design solution effective?</p>
<p>My overall aim was to create a functional, accessible kitchen garden that will allow people of all abilities, physicalities and ages to enjoy growing edible plants.</p>
<p>The design solution will achieve this very nicely, although just how well it does so will only be known in time, should it be implemented as per my design. </p>
<p>In my goal articulation, I spoke broadly about what I would like to achieve, but again, many of those goals will not be fulfilled until the design has been implemented. There is no reason to think that they would not all be met.</p>
<ul>
<li data-list="bullet">produces a wide variety of food crops <span style="color: #ff00ff;">The beds provide enough space to grow a good variety of crops</span></li>
<li data-list="bullet">increases biodiversity <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Although to create the beds a good number of volunteer plants will need to be removed, the overall project will make up for this loss and the introduction of a wide variety of other plants will increase the biodiversity.</span></li>
<li data-list="bullet">provides opportunities for people to learn and connect with nature/the growing process <span style="color: #ff00ff;">The learning opportunities provided by the kitchen garden are excellent.</span></li>
<li data-list="bullet">is accessible for everyone and can engage a diverse range of people <span style="color: #ff00ff;">The site should be highly accessible as I carefully followed the guidelines given by Thrive </span></li>
<li data-list="bullet">is not only sustainable but also regenerative <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Although this is a little vague, the kitchen garden can regenerate the land by increasing biodiversity and having people on the site to care for it, drawing people in to get involved with other regenerative projects</span></li>
<li data-list="bullet">strengthens the local community and is shaped by the local community <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Having provided the design, local people could be invited to develop the project and take ownership of it</span></li>
<li data-list="bullet">looks beautiful, to inspire and engage <span style="color: #ff00ff;">This is subjective, but to my mind the design is aesthetically pleasing and would inspire and engage others</span></li>
<li data-list="bullet">uses environmentally friendly and organic methods - reducing waste, recycling/reusing. free from pesticides, herbicides, no peat, no dig, less fossil fuels (hand tools rather than power tools) <span style="color: #ff00ff;">I recommended and costed for recycled plastic materials for the raised beds but I have no control over if any of these or any of the environmentally methods are used.</span></li>
<li data-list="bullet">uses local resources, especially waste from on site, e.g. woodchip, leaves and grass clippings <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Apart from the woodchipped area, I did not incorporate these resources into this design. An additional compost design could include them in the future. </span></li>

<p>Here I look at the principles a bit more in-depth than just sticking a hashtag next to them! </p>

<p>Although creating a kitchen garden where the focus isn't about growing crops may seem strange, it is actually appropriate to the mother project. If the mother project goes ahead, the kitchen garden will provide many benefits. If the mother project doesn't go ahead, the kitchen garden can still function as a discrete system.</p>
<p>Taking on the role of stewardship of this land means that I have a responsibility to the wildlife community as well as human community, so I have included as many regenerative solutions as possible, such composting systems, water catchment, permeable paths and raised beds made of sustainable materials.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fk0n2no7e7">Reflection on the design process</h2>
<p><strong>What I learnt about permaculture through the design process<br></strong>I learnt a new framework.</p>
<p>I am starting to see that there is skill in selecting what to survey and to what level of detail to record data.</p>
<p>I feel as though I'm getting the hang of what is a function, a system and an element - this really baked my noodle but by going through it methodically, it started to make sense.</p>
<p>Through having not done a sector analysis, I started to see it's purpose!</p>
<p><strong>What I learnt about myself through the design process<br></strong>I recognise that I wasn't methodical enough. I realised that in rushing ahead with ideas meant that I missed important steps out, steps that would have facilitated deeper thought processes. I went back over things where I could, but it was too late to make changes to the final design. To be fair to myself, the deadline was a tight one and I didn't really have time for much deliberation. Once I have completed the diploma, those processes should be well imbedded into my thought processes so that I use them automatically.</p>
<p><strong>How this design process has helped me<br></strong>It has helped me to see the process I would follow with sufficient time. Looking back at it now, it has made me think of other opportunities that are on the site, such as water catchment on a big scale, and incorporating rain gardens.</p>
<p id="mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1iv"><strong>What went well?<br></strong>I realised that I should have done a client interview. As it would have been like shutting the gate after the horse had bolted, I looked at the goal articulation and defined the functions from this. It was a bit of a bodge job, but it worked just fine. I was pleased that I had come up with a solution...a solution for a problem when looking for a solution for a solution...oh dear, I feel like I'm in the Matrix.</p>
<p id="mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j0"><strong>What was challenging?<br></strong>I thought that using a different framework, one that looked a bit simpler, would make the process easier. This wasn't the case. I think that my main difficulty is working out which elements go under which headings, and that is just something that will become clearer as I progress through the diploma. </p>
<p>There wasn't enough time for prolonged observation</p>
<p id="mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j1"><strong>Long term vision and goals<br></strong></p>
<p>The long term vision is that this kitchen garden is part of a bigger community garden that is able to sustain itself financially.</p>
<p id="mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j2"><strong>Next achievable steps</strong></p>
<p>This project is now on hold, so there are no next achievable steps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ROSE -</strong> Signifies a success. What is working well related to the focus area?</p>
<p><strong>THORN </strong>- Signifies a challenge. What's not working well related to the focus area?</p>
<p><strong>BUD</strong> - Signifies potential. What could be developed related to the focus area?</p>

<td style="width: 19.1964%; height: 238px;">These helped me picture what it was that I was going for, it really does sound like a wonderful project!</td>
<td style="width: 33.0358%; height: 238px;">These were a bit vague</td>
<td style="width: 27.3809%; height: 238px;">In future designs I could have objectives or smart goals that are measurable</td>

<td style="width: 20.3869%; height: 620px;">Tools</td>
<td style="width: 19.1964%; height: 620px;">The Functions/Systems/Elements tool helped me see gaps in my thinking</td>
<td style="width: 33.0358%; height: 620px;">My biggest mistake in this project was failing to see who the client was. You might wonder how I could have got this wrong, but the start of this project was  disjointed and confusing, and time was short. Had I pinpointed the true client, I would have done a client interview on them, rather than myself</td>
<td style="width: 27.3809%; height: 620px;">It would have been good to do a diagram to show how the systems intertwined. Sector analysis would have shown how the larger site and buildings would have interacted with the site.</td>

<td style="width: 20.3869%; height: 511px;">Framework</td>
<td style="width: 19.1964%; height: 511px;">I found it a fairly straightforward framework, I like that goals are considered first </td>
<td style="width: 33.0358%; height: 511px;">I chose this framework because it seemed fairly straightforward, and it was, except that it offers Evaluation and Tweak as options, but for the accreditation, these need to be included, so I had to go back and do them.</td>
<td style="width: 27.3809%; height: 511px;">I think for my next land-based design I would use SADIMET and follow Aranya's instructions to the letter, so that I know what goes where</td>

<tr style="height: 320px;">
<td style="width: 20.3869%; height: 320px;">Ethics</td>
<td style="width: 19.1964%; height: 320px;">The people care ethic is very strong in this design, as accessibility was a priority.</td>
<td style="width: 33.0358%; height: 320px;">Education was listed as a function, but then not really addressed. I think this comes back to a lack of clarity around the aims of the project.</td>
<td style="width: 27.3809%; height: 320px;">Fair share wasn't addressed sufficiently, although I considered it at length. </td>

<tr style="height: 320px;">
<td style="width: 20.3869%; height: 320px;">Principles</td>
<td style="width: 19.1964%; height: 320px;">I like the Holmgren principles, they are fairly straightforward</td>
<td style="width: 33.0358%; height: 320px;">I found it difficult to integrate the principles into my write up</td>
<td style="width: 27.3809%; height: 320px;">I feel a bit as though I shoe-horned them in at the end. I will consider them earlier in future</td>

<tr style="height: 538px;">
<td style="width: 20.3869%; height: 538px;">Survey</td>
<td style="width: 19.1964%; height: 538px;">I feel as though the survey is adequate for the design. Good enough is good enough.</td>
<td style="width: 33.0358%; height: 538px;">I would have liked to have had more time to make observations and record data. I would have liked to have measured the height of the surrounding trees. I would have liked to have drawn shade diagrams. Time was not on my side. </td>
<td style="width: 27.3809%; height: 538px;">I received feedback that a video of the site would have been useful. I will include that in my next land-based design</td>

<tr style="height: 210px;">
<td style="width: 20.3869%; height: 210px;">Analysis</td>
<td style="width: 19.1964%; height: 210px;">Aspects of the design mean that the energy needed to maintain it decreases over time, while its outputs increase</td>
<td style="width: 33.0358%; height: 210px;">I don't feel as though I clearly explained how some of the limiting factors were addressed by the design</td>
<td style="width: 27.3809%; height: 210px;">A more methodical approach would allow for clearer analysis</td>

<tr style="height: 347px;">
<td style="width: 20.3869%; height: 347px;">Decisions</td>
<td style="width: 19.1964%; height: 347px;">I produced a well thought out design, with good accessibility and a pleasing aesthetic. </td>
<td style="width: 33.0358%; height: 347px;">As this was a fairly straightforward kitchen garden design, I don't feel as though there were any particularly innovative design decisions made. </td>
<td style="width: 27.3809%; height: 347px;">I didn't include any information about the plant choices. I would do this for the next land based design</td>

<td style="width: 19.1964%; height: 320px;">Breaking each section down and using the Rose/Thorn/Bud tool has helped me see the gaps in my work. </td>
<td style="width: 33.0358%; height: 320px;">This feels much the same as reflection. I'm not sure I have done this part correctly!</td>
<td style="width: 27.3809%; height: 320px;">I will use this process again, either for reflection or evaluation or both, once I have had feedback.</td>

<p>Does this design really lack resilience? If it's the case that a truly resilient design has systems and elements that serve more than one function, this isn't a resilient design. But also, I think that there may be functions that have not been identified or included, so some of the systems and elements are actually doing more than I am giving them credit for. How can it be that everything has to serve three functions? Does this mean that some elements should be excluded?  I would like to explore this in my future design work.</p>

                <p>This is the place where I take an overview of my design work and summarise my thoughts on the process. I will identify and discuss the key things that I've learnt, looking at how the designs influenced my learning and each other. I'll go through the most significant realisations I had about the various tools, frameworks and resources that I used.</p>
<h2>Midpoint reflection</h2>
<p>Although officially I started in 2018, that year was completely taken up with the studentship I did with the RHS. Having said that, I didn’t really start work on it properly until 2020, when I joined the guild. The job at Wibsey (where I did the compost design) also spurred me on - the real need for practical solutions was a boon to my motivation.</p>
<p>I did lots of designs, or at least the bare bones of several designs that didn’t make it into the portfolio. They were an important part of my learning process. I did one about right livelihood, another about the structure of a large-scale community garden project, a cut flower garden design, two forest gardens and a design for the raised beds area at Wibsey, amongst others. But then when I came to document them, I realised that a lot of them had too many big gaps in, so they didn’t make the grade. This informed the first of my key learnings:</p>
<p><strong>The importance of being methodical<br></strong>I found that following the framework as closely as possible was helpful, although I did find that moving from one step to another that was out of sequence was necessary at times. This was especially true of times when I was struggling with the sequence and really needed to get the clarity that another step could provide, such as having goals/aims. This also helped when I was confused about just what goes under which heading, i.e. analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Tools are really awesome<br></strong>But you have to find the right one, and if you can’t find the right one, create a new one that fits the job.</p>
<p>As a gardener, I know when to use a fork and not a spade. When a saw is better than loppers. But with Permaculture design, sometimes the right tool isn’t completely obvious. I didn’t always know exactly what I was trying to do. So I modified tools. I started using SWOC, and changed it to SW. I used random assembly but modified it so that it also included notes and ideas that related to specific areas.</p>
<p>As someone who can tend to be a bit too self-critical, I found the reflection tools ‘Roses, Thorns and Buds’ and ‘De Bono’s Six Hats’ were very helpful. They forced my brain to use pathways that it’s not accustomed to, to consider things from different perspectives. How marvellous.</p>
<p><strong>They’re not You<br></strong>Ok, full disclosure; I’m not actually there yet with this one, but it’s wafting around in my psyche, so I think it’ll manifest at some point…So this is about designing with fixed ideas about how the design should be done, what the client needs and what they should get. The inspiration for this thinking came from a Brenna Quinlan Instagram post and as I read it, I started to hear a little voice (not literally) and a finger gently prodding me (that turned out to be my dog kicking me in his sleep), saying ‘you do that, that’s you that is’. Fair enough, hands up, I am stubborn and a bit too rigid in my thinking. So I’m off to TK Maxx to get myself a whole rainbow of hats. I’ll show that Bono character – six? Better make that ten! HA!<br><br><strong>Good enough is good enough<br></strong>Not usually something I’m particularly good at upholding, but when surveying I think it’s an important one. A lot of time and energy can be saved by really thinking through what is needed. And this is another reason why I think goal setting first is important because otherwise, you might overlook the need to survey some things and survey aspects that you didn’t need to. Going back to do things that you’ve missed off isn’t always possible.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation is Key<br></strong>Through the documentation process I realised that the way I presented some of my designs to people had a detrimental effect on the projects themselves. My fixation with Miro meant that I didn’t realise that not everyone loved it as much as me. Submitting designs that are only half done is also not helpful as people can’t see how the whole thing fits together. However, when time is short or you’re submitting speculative designs, or not getting paid, it’s hard to give get the balance right. I guess that’s something that comes with experience.</p>
<p><strong>Meta confusion<br></strong>Ok, so this bakes my noodle massively and it’s going ot be difficult to put into words, so please bear with me.<br>When I’m working on a design, I can start mixing up the actual design work with the design process. And when evaluating or reflecting (and don’t get me started on how the heck to tell those to heckin’ things apart) I can slide into thinking about the process rather than the design and not realise. It’s something that I struggle with but will probably click into place at some point. I hope.</p>
<p><strong>Other thoughts<br></strong>I wanted to use my diploma to find practical and/or holistic ways to find positive solutions and I feel as though I’ve done this to certain degree. Because they were done retrospectively, I feel as though sometimes they were a bit gappy. Not having implemented the two land designs meant that a lot of learning was missing and I feel that this is evident from the work presented. I would very much like to fill that gap in the final half of my diploma.<br><br><strong>Last thought<br></strong>Having completed my first five designs I am feeling much more confident in my understanding of permaculture design. So much so that I am finding it hard not to get stuck into the next five right away. I'm supposed to be having a breather though so they'll have to wait. Right?</p>
