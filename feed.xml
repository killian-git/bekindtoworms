                <p>When I started my diploma, I wanted to know what fitted where; 'is this bit analysis, or is it part of the survey still?', 'is this evaluation, or is it reflection?'. I wanted frameworks that were straightforward, linear. I heeded the caution of some not to jump ahead to coming up with ideas, until you'd done your survey. I couldn't get my head around nonlinear frameworks, didn't know where things fitted. At about design fiveish, I thought I was getting the hang of it. Then somewhere in the swirling, overlapping blur of designs that followed, I happened upon the work of Dan Palmer and his Making Permaculture Stronger podcast. And through that, I stumbled upon the wonderful, unsettling work of Carol Sanford. I started to realise that designing is, without a doubt, nonlinear. I had to accept that what I had learnt so far was a really just a good basis for exploring designs that didn't always, if ever, follow rules.</p>
<p>It was an uncomfortable place to be and I was miffed. I wrote to Dan Palmer and told him so. I told him I didn't have time for these revelations, I had deadlines! He loved that and encouraged me to languish in the 'bewildering fertility of the void'. He thought perhaps we could do a podcast together and over a few emails, we had the merest hatchings of a plan for a podcast which would start; "In this episode, I interview a well-intentioned buffoon with more questions than answers" because that is pretty much how I described myself to him. </p>
<p>Yes, that well-intentioned buffoon with more questions than answers was me. Little old me. </p>
<p>Well, sadly, we will never make that podcast because Dan died as I was writing up my final design, which was profoundly influenced by him.</p>
<p>Dan has been a huge inspiration to me and I would like to dedicate my diploma to him. </p>
<p>I will continue to be bewildered, to question everything, to explore Living Design Systems and I will listen very, very carefully to Carol Sanford.</p>
<p>Blessings and heartfelt gratitude to you Dan, may you be at peace.</p>

We both wanted to explore the methods, and as Killian is integral to any work we do at Ridge and Furrow Farm, we decided that we would collaborate on this design.  We have included some of the theory and our thinking around it.</p>

<p>Myself and my partner Killian are staying at Ridge and Furrow Farm and we can see lots of potential for growing food and flowers, maybe to even grow seed crops. The farm needs help with their horticultural operations, and we thought that it would be pertinent to come up with a design to look at how  this might be achieved</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1ga96f3vc2">Design Approach</h2>
<p>What do we want to do? <br>Inspired by Dan Palmer’s conversations with Carol Sanford, we wanted to explore living systems thinking, to step away from frameworks that have come out of conventional thinking that tend to be used in a mechanistic and fragmentary way that do not represent the true potential of the whole.</p>
<p>We also use the initial steps of the HDM process in order to act as an interface between the results of that and the development of a decision-making process with the wider growing team.</p>
<p>Why can we do this here? <br>Ridge and Furrow Farm is an open and collaborative environment where the idea to produce this design came out of an interest in how systems and people can evolve.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ga9tn93i2bd">Purpose of the Design</h2>
<p>The owners of the farm would like to grow vegetables for their own use, but previous endeavours have had limited success.</p>
<p>There are several areas on the site that could be developed for growing, and there may be potential for a growing enterprise to sustain someone, who could also maintain/oversee the horticultural operations on the farm.</p>
<p>This design will look at the feasibility of this idea by assessing specific growing options, resources and infrastructure.</p>
<p>This design is limited to identifying potential as a starting point for engagement with the farm team.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1ga9tn93i2be">About the Farm</h2>
<p>Andrew and Kendra Henderson bought the farm in 2010. It is home to them and their two teenage sons, as well as Kendra’s parents. They grow a variety of herbs which are processed to make non-alcoholic spirits.</p>
<p>In addition to the herb business, they have a number of workshops and studios that are rented by local people. Ridge and Furrow is people-centred, with a commitment to community development, education and creativity.</p>
<p>The herb growing operations are undertaken by Kendra and a staff member, Briony, who lives on site.</p>
<p>The farm has organic certification. It is approximately 6.4 acres in size.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ga9tn93i2bf">Ridge and Furrow Needs/Wants</h2>
<p>We gleaned the following from discussions with members of the Ridge and Furrow Farm team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help with gardening in the kitchen/rose garden</li>
<li>Help with site maintenance</li>
<li>Lovely green spaces</li>
<li>Waste cycling</li>
<li>Help with planning</li>
<li>Support with getting things done (e.g. aquaponics)</li>
<li>Help with growing vegetables</li>
<li>General horticultural advice</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1ga9tn93i2bi">Framework</h2>
<p>We used Carol Sanford's Regenerative Life as a framework. The explanation is quite wordy. Lots of great words of course, but because it is so wordy, I've put it all in a Power Point presentation so you can look through the slides at your leisure. Or scroll on. I mean, I wouldn't recommend the latter because this bit is probably the most interesting bit of my whole portfolio, IMHO.</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uks8eI_50WxccQ5SkIh-4wbpTa1ywII8/preview" allow="autoplay"></iframe></figure>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ga9tn93i2bj">Holistic Decision Making</h2>
<p>The vision we identified through the Regenerative Life exploration then informed our next step, which was to introduce the initial phase of HDM.</p>
<p>We looked at the Five Questions, and came up with some Quality of Life Statements.</p>
<p>These could be brought forward into further discussions with the client, at which point it may be deemed appropriate to work through the following phases of HDM.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ga9tn93i2bk">The Five Questions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Question one: what is the Whole?</em></strong><br>The horticultural operations at the farm</p>
<p><em><strong>Question two: who are the decision makers?</strong></em><br>At the moment, growing decisions are made by Kendra and Briony, but with regards to the proximate decisions, it would be Kendra and Andrew and then specific growing decisions could be widened out to whoever is growing crops</p>
<p><strong><em>Question three: what is the existing resource base?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Social/family</strong><br>broader farm team – support network, volunteers</p>
<p><strong>Personal/experiential</strong><br>skills, experience, desire to develop skill set and experience </p>
<p><strong>Living</strong><br>biodiversity, organic certification, ridge and furrow, accessible water   table, open aspect, windbreak, various potential growing areas – see   map, willow, various plants for preparations</p>
<p><strong>Financial </strong> <br>unknown</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual </strong> <br>deep respect and love for nature, desire to work in harmony with land</p>
<p><strong>Material</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Accommodation; caravan, cabin, camping space, yurt</li>
<li>Equipment; tractor, lawnmower, strimmer, broadfork, hand tools, buckets, wheelbarrows, black plastic tarps, gloves, Enviromesh, tractor with flail mower and front loader, timber, pallets</li>
<li>Land</li>
<li>Basic temporary irrigation</li>
<li>Makeshift propagation space – ‘greenhouse’</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Question four: how is the 'whole' unique?</strong></em></p>
<p>The ridge and furrow field possibly dates back to medieval times.</p>
<p>There is a good deal of biodiversity, and the farm has organic certification from the Soil Association.</p>
<p>There is a good demand for organic, locally grown produce- Core, a shop in Leamington Spa, have already expressed an interest.</p>
<p>It is unique because it could start small and expand according to demand.<br><br>It’s also possible to set systems that weave together to maximise efficiencies. This can be done with the existing herb growing and processing operations.</p>

<figcaption >Nested wholes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em><strong>Question five: how is the 'whole' nested in other structures and how are other structures nested within the 'whole'?</strong></em></p>
<p>The horticultural operations are nested within the whole of Ridge and Furrow Farm. There are other wholes nested within the farm that may have relationships with the horticultural operations. We need to review them and see which ought to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Skills audit, client interviews, find overlaps of common resources, infrastructure, limitations</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1ga9tn93i2bl">Quality of Life Statements</h3>
<p>In design nine I created a workshop to introduce HDM, as the starting point towards creating a Holistic Context for the farm. If this had been completed, this could have been used to base the Quality of Life Statements on, but instead, we used the ideas generated in the exploration of the Regenerative Life framework.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1ga9tn93i2bm">Ethics</h2>
<p><strong>How do the quality of life statements evidence the ethics at the heart of this design?</strong></p>
<p>We grow an abundance of produce that provides nutrient dense food for the whole farm and many other people   <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Fair Share</strong></span></p>
<p>We regenerate the soil and the surrounding environment  <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Earth Care</strong></span></p>
<p>The work is enjoyable and fulfilling <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> People Care</strong></span></p>
<p>We maximise the potential of the site and minimise the need for importing resources  <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Earth/ Future Care</strong></span></p>
<p>Environmental pollutants have been eliminated  <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Earth/Future Care</strong></span></p>
<p>Rainwater is the only source of irrigation  <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">Earth Care</span></strong></p>
<p>The horticultural systems are seamlessly integrated into the whole of Ridge and Furrow <br><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Future Care</strong></span></p>
<p>Because we have taken a Living Systems approach, we are looking first at soil regeneration, water catchment/cycling,etc. <span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">The vegetable crops are a result of this approach, rather than being the starting point.

<h2 id="mcetoc_1gab8ilq22mc">Principles</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><br>We used Carol Sanford's principles that are in her book 'A Regenerative Life'.<br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/2022-08-12-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/2022-08-12-2-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/2022-08-12-2-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/2022-08-12-2-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/2022-08-12-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/2022-08-12-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/29/responsive/2022-08-12-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1920" height="1080"></figure>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1ga9tn93i2bn">From qualitative to quantitative</h2>
<p>There currently isn’t a lot of information about applying the Regenerative Life approach to land-based designs, so we integrated the Permaculture tools and methods into the process. Having considered the nature of the whole living system, there was a clear need to quantify the existing system and create a more detailed profile of the existing resource base and a look at the potential resource base, particularly with regards to growing areas was needed.</p>
<p>Although it looks like SADI, everything that follows on from the survey is informed by the Regenerative Life and HDM analysis, rather than just the survey data. The essence of the design process is about always staying connected to the whole that is being considered and how it is nested within other wholes.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1gab8ilq22md">Survey</h2>
<p>We did a survey to initially explore the opportunities and limitations of the site, the existing resource base and to see what operations were already in place. I am not including it here so as to protect the farm's privacy.</p>

</table>
<p>There are of course, many risks, such as drought, recession etc. but these are too broad and we chose not to consider them for this design. Our intention was to create a resilient whole that would put us in the best position no matter what happens in the future.</p>
<p>The risks in the chart all highlight the fact that if we were to set up a growing enterprise at the farm, we would need to be a separate entity, working within the other systems and projects. A communication design for the farm has been identified as a need overall, and that would provide support our project as well as the whole farm.</p>

<p>We did a basic investigation into the potential sites for a polytunnel and for composting systems, you can see them <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/PolytunnelCompostsiting.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1gagi68c42rk">Imaging the Operations</h3>
<p>We created a diagram to help us visualise the existing operations, the potential developments and ideas that had come up, and how they might relate to each other.</p>
<p>The following is not a detailed systems diagram, it is just meant as an aid and starting point to understanding what the ‘whole’ looks/could look like in broad operational terms.</p>
<p>This exercise showed us where resources overlap.</p>
<p>It helped us to set priorities, e.g, we saw that the chickens were more demanding resource-wise than say, the anaerobic digestor.</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1gagk84b0358">Notes on planting plans/methods</h3>
<p>We would start by developing the capacity for growing veg and flowers for the farm, and then begin to expand with a view to selling surplus.</p>
<p>Soil regeneration is key. We will utilise the following methods: no dig, green manures, mulching, soil amendments, variety of farm-made composts/fertilisers incl. Johnson Su Bioreactors, hot compost, wormery products, leafmould, ramial wood chip, comfrey/nettle preparations, leave roots in, crop rotation.</p>
<p>A number of ideas were identified that would meet an immediate need or aspiration and would also evolve the capacity of the whole;</p>
<ul>
<li>Compost systems (whole site fertility)</li>
<li>Chickens</li>
<li>Water catchment/irrigation strategy</li>
<li>Aquaponics system</li>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1gagk84b0359">Evaluation of this design</h2>
<p>How will we know if our design has been effective?</p>
<p>Our initial aim was; ‘to decide if growing food and flowers at Ridge and Furrow is feasible, for us and for the folk of Ridge and Furrow’.</p>
<p>We wanted to show the client how their desire to grow vegetables on the farm could be realised. But then the Regenerative Life and HDM processes revealed how the capacity to grow vegetables was part of a larger system that needed to evolve as a whole. The process of considering whole living systems doesn’t really accommodate setting fixed aims and objectives targeted at fragments of those systems.</p>
<p>This design has explored two areas;</p>
<p>1.specifics of crop growing options</p>
<p>Here we reviewed potential specific outcomes to assess the viability of resource requirements and timelines</p>
<p>This was limited by the availability of data. The survey would need to be more in-depth if we were to proceed with the implementation.</p>
<p>2.Resources and infrastructure that can be shared across the whole farm project, e.g. composting/chickens etc. inline with their aspirations.</p>
<p>We considered these thoroughly. What was difficult to get to grips with was the people side of the farm; communication systems, and human resources, what is shared by who and how etc. All of this is still to be determined and this has impacted on our ability to make decisions somewhat.</p>
<p>We’ve analysed the existing systems and developed an understanding of the whole, which we can then carry into the next iteration of HDM. Although it was tempting to cut and paste that last sentence into the aim section on slide two, the learning we have gained from this process has been invaluable.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1gagk84b035a">Implementation for this design</h2>
<p><br>In order to implement this design, we will share it with the Ridge and Furrow team, and use it as a starting point for further explorations, using the Holistic Decision Making process that we started together recently.</p>
<p>We need to come up with a strategy for communicating some of the ideas that underpin the process that we’re asking the client to embark on.</p>
<p>We may need to separate out the theory and the practice and facilitate:</p>
<ul>
<li>A presentation to share the ideas and principles involved</li>
<li>A workshop to apply those to the context of the farm</li>
</ul>

<figure>For phase one I used SADIMET, which is kinda linear (but doesn't have to be). When it came to phase two, I realised I wanted to use a nonlinear framework, so I switched to Looby's Design Web. To demonstrate this, I used Miro. You can check it out <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lfsbkfg=/?share_link_id=385523446665" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and watch the video below to see how to navigate Miro, if you're not familiar with it.</figure>
<p>But if you want to just look at the slide show, scroll on. See how good I am to you? You are very welcome.</p>

<p>During the process of setting up and designing a community gardens, I began to realise that the people I was working with had a different approach to me. There was a lack of clarity, clear communication and planning.</p>
<p>I decided to create a design to get a clearer picture of what was going on, and to find a way of resolving the issues.</p>

<p>You can see the whole design here on <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOgzdRt4=/?share_link_id=683843245266" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miro.</a></p>
<p>Below is a video that talks through the navigation and explains it a bit. I need to change the slides as sadly I couldn't get permissions for all of the artwork. The plan is to do my own artwork... <a href="https://www.brennaquinlan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brenna Quinlan</a> was super kind and said she was happy for me to use her work though, so that ain't going nowhere, I love it.</p>
<p>I don't explain all the slides in the video, so you can pause it as and when. <br>I will be adding the design here in the body of this web page at some point, as the video was really just to show how to navigate Miro.</p>

                <p>My sixth design was about boundaries. It was very personal, so I'm not sharing it in full, but here are a few little snippets.</p>
<p>The design was very useful  as a support for a difficult situation. It provided a framework for making decisions and it was a bit of emergency Permaculture at times! I learned a lot about myself and it helped me think deeply about what I am willing to tolerate, and the strength of one's desires to blind you to the truth of a situation.</p>
<p>It was a good step towards designing collaboratively with my partner. We worked together on two of my other designs that followed after this one.  </p>
<p>The best tool I used was the Circle of Control. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘When we spend our time acting in the wider circle of concern, worrying, generating fear and playing out disaster scenarios of what could happen, we use up available energy that could be spent in our circle of influence. Our circle of influence shrinks as a result of lack of attention and energy and also because the energy spent in worrying disempowers us.</p>
<p>In contrast, when our energy is spent in our circle of influence it expands and we become able to tackle some of the issues that were previously out of reach’</p>
<p>~Looby Macnamara</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is the diagram that I created to visualise my Circle of Control;</p>
