<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I remember being asked by the guy in the job centre when I was 17, where I saw myself in five years’ time!! Hilarious, given that within a year I’d be in a cult, and wouldn’t leave for another six years!</p>
<p>Well, I am asking myself where I’d like to be in five years’ time now. In 10 years’ time, I’d like to be living on the land, with some good folk, fellow guardians of the land. I’d like to be shit-hot at growing food and be skilled in other practical stuff – preserving, cooking, foraging etc. I’d like to have zero carbon footprint. In five years’ time, I’d like to be well on my way to being skilled up. And I’d like to be ridiculously happy. Actually, the latter is the most important…</p>
<p>I would like to do a design that is about how to earn money/get by, perhaps on a system that is not about money…How about being community sufficient? I would like to live in close harmony with the land. At the moment, I live in a second floor flat in Baildon, on the edge of Shipley. It is very much an urban situation. It's quite a far call from where I'd like to be, but **INSERT PRINCIPLE HERE!**</p>
<p>I feel anxious about this endeavour, as though I need to be out there already, learning. I am worried that I should be getting on with looking for a placement…but I am here, now. Perhaps it would be good to enjoy a year working on my diploma, get a part time job, enjoy the allotment, wait for Covid to pass – if it will…sit out the storm. As Burgs said, now is not the time to be venturing forth into new things…chill, make a full recovery from the frozen shoulder and use the time wisely. Get fit again. Look at the list of skills I’d like to acquire and see if I can do any from where I am now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In re-writing it, I felt that I wanted to change the framework, as it's an ongoing design. </p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p><strong>Building Resilience; Uncertainty in Uncertain Times</strong></p>
<p>I have heard people say that Permaculture is not good at helping people to make decisions. That has not been my experience. But then again, I do make some 'bad' decisions. I have learnt more from my mistakes than from my successes, that is for sure, so does it even matter? Permaculture design has helped me make decisions and plans, but mostly, it has provided me with a way of looking at the bigger picture, aligning it with what I value most, and keeping on track with that. </p>
<p>I started out wanting a straightforward framework that I could follow step-by-step. I wanted a Wikihow on Permaculture design. But it began to dawn on me that designing doesn't really work best like that, for me anyway. We are told that when you begin designing, you must do your survey first - yes, you will come up with ideas, but try not to be drawn into them, until the right time. I don't think that is realistic, and I don't think it is at all necessary. By the time I'd got a bit more than halfway with my ten designs, I realised that trying to fit the process into some regimented system was sapping the creativity from me, and restricting my vision. And then the glorious disruption from Dan Palmer and his friend Carol Sanford took me into what Dan refers to as the 'bewildering fertility of the void'. I applied some of their frameworks and tools in my final designs and realised that as far as I'd come with my learning, I didn't really know anything.</p>
<p>Designing is (shock horror) messy. Which is why I love Miro so much, because I can store all my disparate thoughts on it and come back to them when the time is right.</p>
<p>I started my Regenerative Life design in order to create a plan for how I would earn a living whilst remaining true to my aspirations as a Buddhist. I did the design, I had some ideas, we actioned the design, but I still don't know what I'm doing. Ah, the bewildering fertility of the void! </p>
<p>When I started these studies, I thought I'd be learning how to draw really good maps, how to use a bunyip, how to analyse functions, systems and elements, and all that jazz. And of course, I have done that sort of thing, but more importantly, I've realised my shortcomings with regards to communication, to wanting to be in control, to my own rigid thinking. A resilient mind is an open and flexible mind. </p>
<p>Not only that, but when I talk about People Care, Earth Care and Fair Share, I have to really care, and be willing to share. Through the various projects that I have worked on, I have seen how the ethics, and the word 'community' are bandied about. Which leads me to...</p>
<p><strong>Personal, People, Place</strong></p>
<p>I shared my Community Gardens People design in Carla Moss's <a href="https://www.permaculture.org.uk/user/5068/carla-moss/diploma-tutor-profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum</a> and received lots of good advice, but I didn't have time to heed their advice. I then duly forgot about it, as I hadn't done the reflection - probably due to aversion to looking at the project any more, and then got drawn into a whole other story, where all that advice would have served me very nicely. I got back into my pattern! It wasn't until I came to writing up the design that I saw how I might have avoided those pitfalls. I did then put some of the advice to use in the next community situation.</p>
<p>I realised during the Community Gardens design that I wanted to work collaboratively on future designs, so I did with two designs after that. This was particularly successful in my Growing Brookside design, when I collaborated with my partner Killian. Having a different perspective and another brain to work with was a huge benefit. I felt supported, especially as I began to feel overwhelmed by the design, and he learnt a lot about the Permaculture process. </p>
<p>Having a body of work to look back on means that I can see my learning clearly; the patterns, the areas I need to work on in myself, to come to terms with aspects of my character and also, where to set boundaries, and how to make decisions about projects I want to get involved with in the future. I am learning so much about myself.</p>
<p>Doing zone 00 stuff is really important, because people work is really challenging, but it's the most crucial part to learn. Without other people, without being able to work with others, to listen and to respond compassionately, there's no point doing any other type of work. A land design will fall apart if the people working on it can't work together. This reminds me of the nested wholes of the Living Systems work - I am nested within a community that is nested within the land, and all three need to be in harmony for all to thrive. </p>
<p>I probably have more questions now than when I started. Does it really matter if a project doesn't have a plan? Does a Permaculture design really help a project? Is the time invested worthwhile? Afterall, as I stated previously, mistakes are the best way to learn. I suspect that it is better to have a design that doesn't work out than to not have a design at all. Because the number of designs that are implemented exactly according to plans are as rare as hens teeth. </p>
<p>We can be in the moment when we design, and this allows us to be completely in the moment when we action the design, because we have a well-thought out plan that supports the flow of the project. </p>
<p>I feel as though the Permaculture diploma has shaped my life, and Permaculture itself has been an excellent tool for this. The Regenerative Life design was in the background throughout, and each design has led me through a learning process - through projects that didn't turn out how I thought they would but that gave me incredible learning, and I think that because I was designing my way through, I was more open to the learning. And it seems as though it has all culminated in design ten, which has been positively received by the clients, and we have found a place to be where we can meet the goals we set in the Regenerative Life design.</p>

<p>This is a screenshot of a slide from a design I’m writing up for my diploma. My sixth design. It’s a quote from <a class="notranslate" href="https://www.instagram.com/loobymacnamara/" tabindex="0">@loobymacnamara</a> of <a class="notranslate" href="https://www.instagram.com/applewood_permaculture_centre/" tabindex="0">@applewood_permaculture_centre</a><br>The design is about boundaries and the circle of concern tool was of great use, and I think it’s a great tool for daily life. Looby puts it really well 😊</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1g3t65tug6u" dir="auto">Day one 21/05/22</h2>
<div dir="auto">Today was day one of 100 days of Permaculture!!!</div>
<div dir="auto">I’ve been working on my Diploma in Applied Permaculture since 2019, and I’m halfway through. I’ve got to raise my game as I’ve just been given the go ahead to do my accreditation event at this year’s National Permaculture Gathering. Yoiks! So, to keep up the momentum, I’m going to do a 100 day challenge. I’ll be posting every day, until the event. There’s more than 100 days but I’m off on retreat, but I can still fit in 100).</div>
<div dir="auto">Luckily, I’m at a lovely farm @Brookside.eco.farm where Permaculture is very much embraced, and it looks as though we might be staying! I’ll be doing at least one design for them, there’s lots of exciting stuff happening!</div>
<div dir="auto">These pictures are of the incredible WET system they had installed. It cleans all the grey and brown water from the main buildings, as it passes through five ponds. The water is cleaned by diverse range of trees and perennials, many of which provide food or other uses. By the fifth pond, it’s clean enough to swim in!</div>
<div dir="auto">Not only that, walking through it is heavenly.</div>
<div dir="auto">Also, Benji has become a reluctant member of a pack of four dogs, this is Trewa. It was quite a challenge to get a shot of them together.</div>
<div dir="auto">Today I finished the amendments for my first five designs. I’m taking on a big challenge, but I’m going to give it everything I’ve got. I hope you’ll enjoy following my progress-wish me luck!!</div>

<p>Wibsey Community Gardens is on a 2.5 acre site that was previously the Bradford Council Parks Dept shrub nursery. It was leased to Bradford Community Environment Project (BCEP) until they folded and the site was taken on by Bradford Organic Community Services in 2017. I was employed BOCS in 2020 as community gardener. The site has three commercial polytunnels and also a large number of raised beds in the open ground. The key objective of my role was to grow produce.</p>
<p>I saw the need and possibility of producing compost, to support the fruit and vegetable production.<br>A lot of organic materials are available for use on the site. It would be possible to recycle them and turn them into high quality compost to support the growth of healthy plants. There is potential to create different types of compost for different purposes.<br>The current composting system is not working. It has been neglected and doesn't function effectively. There are many opportunities for composting waste that are being missed.</p>

<p>What are the priorities?</p>
<ul>
<li>To create high quality compost to support food production</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the additional things it would be nice to have?</p>
<ul>
<li>to train staff and volunteers how to use the compost systems</li>
<li>To run composting workshops for staff, volunteers and visitors</li>
<li>Food waste collection/donation from local community</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the vision for the site?</p>
<ul>
<li>To be community-sufficient in compost</li>
<li>To have efficient, low maintenance systems </li>
<li>To have a straightforward system that processes all waste from the veg production areas</li>
<li>For the systems to be close to where waste is produced</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There is a small budget available for the overall growing project and some of it can be used for the composting systems. Investments made in composting systems will result in savings in the future as it will reduce or even prevent the need to buy in compost.</span></p>
<p>Timescale - It would be beneficial to start developing the compost systems straightaway, so as to reduce the need for buying in compost next year.</p>
<p>The different composts will take between six months and two years to cure. </p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1fm2ga2fkr8">Why is compost needed?</h3>
<p>There are 144 raised beds on the site. A wide variety of food crops are grown in these, to be sold to visitors, cafes and shops. The growing media in the beds is depleted as crops have been harvested but they have not been adequately topped up with compost, if at all. The beds need topping up as a matter of urgency. In the first year, it will be necessary to top up with bought-in compost but this is expensive and results in increased carbon emissions. </p>
<p>Healthy soil means healthy crops that are more resilient to pests and drought. Healthy soil also yields crops with higher nutritional content. </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bq">Why a redesign?</h3>
<p>The current system is not effective because;</p>
<ul>
<li>The current bays are too far from most of the working areas</li>
<li>Workers don't know what to put where so they dump everything on The Heap</li>
<li>The compost bays are not safe as the paths are slippery and there is run-off pooling on the paths </li>
<li>Grass clippings from the bowling green in the park are being used. It is likely that these contain chemical treatments such as pesticides and herbicides</li>
<li>The current bays are wooden and are rotting</li>
<li>There are bits of timber lying around, some with nails in</li>
<li>The Heap is now home to nesting birds, foxes and possibly hedgehogs and more</li>
<li>There is very little compost being made on site, and a lot is needed</li>
<li>The volunteer who was maintaining the compost bays could not continue due to the pandemic</li>
<li>Workers have little knowledge about composting</li>
</ul>
<p>What is working well?</p>
<ul>
<li>There are some good paths in place</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1fm2ga2fkr9">The Site</h3>
<p>I used Miro software for parts of the survey. It is tricky to navigate so I have created a video to talk through the process. </p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kuGKmlR_1vI" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1flejnboo1gi">Site Location</h3>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bh">Climate and landform</h3>
<p>In choosing what to survey, I thought about the design and it's requirements. I wanted to make sure I was only surveying that which was pertinent to the design. For example, there was no point in doing soil tests because nearly all of the growing at this stage is done in raised beds.</p>
<p>Climate does affect composting to a point, but in the climate of West Yorkshire, the effects are negligible.</p>
<p>Rainfall is significant throughout the year.</p>
<p>Prevailing winds are from the west. As the site is on a hill, it is a windy site and the average windspeed is 19 km/h. Gusting speeds can be as high as 90km/h (worldwideweatheronline.com)</p>

<p>I did a very rough zoning exercise, to think about how the site is used.</p>
<p>Zone 1 is where most activity takes place.</p>
<p>Zone 2 is where quite a lot of activity takes place</p>
<p>Zone 3 is visited sometimes</p>
<p>Zone 4 is is rarely visited</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bi">Sector analysis</h3>
<p>I decided that sector analysis wasn't necessary for this design, it was enough to know which way the prevailing winds came from so that strong winds do not damage any systems put in place.</p>
<p>Flood zones were considered as building a compost system in an area that floods could cause run off pollution and nutrient loss as well as slowing down the composting process.</p>
<p>Frost is not usually an issue when making and using compost as it isn't generally used in winter and systems are adequately covered to protect against the elements.</p>
<p>Drought will not be significant enough to affect the composting systems and use thereof.</p>
<p>Sun mapping is not required.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bj">Water systems</h3>
<p>I have included these in the survey video as some composting systems may require irrigation.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bk">Soil</h3>
<p>The majority of the crops are grown in raised beds, so soil testing would not have been appropriate. There are a large number of beds and they have been topped up with various substrates at different times, so each bed would have had to have been tested, which would not be a sensible use of resources.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bo">Site utilities</h3>
<p>The site has running water and electricity. Polytunnel 3 has an electricity point.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bp">Free or cheap resources</h3>
<p><strong>Organic waste from the site</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>pernicious weeds</li>
<li>other weeds</li>
<li>willow branches</li>
<li>hazel branches</li>
<li>food waste from volunteers and workers</li>
</ul>
<p>The site is within a highly urbanised area, so there are many opportunities for sourcing cheap and free materials such as;</p>
<ul>
<li>woodchip from local arborist</li>
<li>leaves collected by local council</li>
<li>food waste from box scheme when it is up and running </li>
<li>IBCs can be purchased cheaply</li>
<li>Manure from staff's family</li>
<li>Pallets</li>
<li>Cardboard</li>
<li>Old fencing that could be re-purposed</li>
</ul>
<p>One key resource is land - there is plenty of space to install any number of composting systems </p>
<p>The urban location also means that it is relatively easy to take deliveries of other materials, such as building materials.</p>

<p>As willow and hazel increase with modest use, it makes a lot of sense to use them for ramial woodchip. </p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5br">Goals</h3>
<p><strong>Needs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>make enough compost to meet needs on site to be community sufficient</li>
<li>close the loop of organic material being wasted/processed inefficiently</li>
<li>create low maintenance systems</li>
<li>make sure that weeds are composted effectively so that weed seed and roots are killed in the process</li>
<li>design durable systems - sustainability is met through implementation of ethics</li>
<li>place systems where they are needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Aims for the future/separate designs</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure workers are safe  - this is part of the clean-up project</li>
<li>provide workers with clear guidance on how to use systems - this is part of communication and training project</li>
<li>ensure future gardeners understand the system - this is part of communication and training project</li>
</ul>
<p>I then converted these into SMART goals, shown below. Each goal is numbered and on a coloured sticky note so you can follow the progression of each goal through the five questions.</p>

<p>I thought about the goals and created <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/minimindmapsGoals.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini mind maps</a> of each one. I'm not sure why, or what they do...</p>
<p>I did <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/PlusMinusCompostingSystems.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plus and minus analysis</a> of a variety of systems</p>
<p>Then I looked more in-depth at the <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/CompostingSystems.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systems</a> that seemed like the best fit</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--wide" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/the-heap-area.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/the-heap-area-xs.jpg 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/the-heap-area-sm.jpg 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/the-heap-area-md.jpg 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/the-heap-area-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/the-heap-area-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/the-heap-area-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="" width="1920" height="368">

<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bt">Decisions</h2>
<p>The key decisions were about what systems to use and where to put them. </p>
<p>I decided to use a wide variety of systems so that all of the materials on offer could be utilised.  As there was no shortage of space, there was room for a good number of systems.</p>
<p>I made a video in which I explain my design decisions;</p>
<figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dj_imnJmHgo" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bu">Implementation</h2>
<p>The implementation plan including; a project plan in the form of a Gantt chart, a breakdown of costings, chipper research and implementation of each system can be seen <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Implementation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5bv">Maintenance</h2>
<p>To a certain extent, using the systems is a major part of their maintenance. As one function for the systems was 'low maintenance', as a whole the system should be fairly low maintenance.</p>
<p>I wrote a basic <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Maintenance plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maintenance plan</a>. It is only basic because I did not stay in that job. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/maintenancePlan.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/maintenancePlan-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/maintenancePlan-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/maintenancePlan-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/maintenancePlan-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/maintenancePlan-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/17/responsive/maintenancePlan-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="1436" height="803"></figure>
<p>Had I stayed, I would have done a design around communication for how to use the systems. This would have allowed more people to be involved in the maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c0">Evaluation</h2>
<p>In-depth evaluation was not possible for this design as it wasn't implemented. But as far as I can tell, if the design had been implemented, the SMART goals would have been achieved. <br><br></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c1">Tweak</h2>
<p>Looking back at this design I can imagine that it would have been necessary to build a composting system in the old raised beds area. I chose not to put one there as I wasn't sure how much capacity we needed for the outdoor raised beds waste and I wanted to make sure that the one-turn system had enough material. </p>
<p>I would hope that we would have found a way to produce ramial wood chip. As the forest garden project was a long way from being implemented and using rwc in vegetable beds can be tricky, it was maybe for the best. </p>
<p>I suspect that some systems would have performed better and that those may have replaced ones that didn't do as well. But having incorporated a divers range of systems means that the best fit would have become evident over time.</p>
<p>Availability of inputs may have changed such as if the tree surgeons stopped providing free wood chip or we may have set up a community composting system. Developing systems for these changes would have been necessary</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c2">Principles</h2>
<p>In addition to those mentioned in the design decisions video, below are the ways that the principles come into use </p>
<p><strong>Catch and Store Energy: </strong>By developing systems that collect resources when they are abundant, we can use them in times of need.</p>
<p>In closing the nutrient loop by gathering organic materials and recycling them into compost, what would have been lost has been put to best use. </p>
<p><strong>Obtain a Yield: </strong>Ensure that you are getting truly useful rewards as part of the work that you are doing.</p>
<p>This is a key principle for this design. The main yield is compost, and it a invaluable resource for the broader project. The efficiencies integrated into this design will mean that the yield is increased at little cost and with myriad benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Use &amp; value renewable resources &amp; services: </strong>Make the best use of nature’s abundance to reduce our consumptive behaviour and dependence on non-renewable resources.</p>
<p>Another key principle, the design is energy and resource efficient, using resources that are on site or free. By making our own compost, we are closing the loop, and reducing use of peat, synthetic fertilisers, perlite, plastics and fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Using salvaged materials where possible to build the compost systems reduces the need for purchasing new materials that have a carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Using willow and hazel for ramial wood chip  means that a resource that is truly renewable is being put to good use, and as using it actually increases the resource and reduces growth that is problematic, the benefits are numerous.</p>
<p><strong>Produce no waste: </strong>By valuing and making use of all the resources that are available to us, nothing goes to waste.</p>
<p>By valuing all plant material, including so-called pernicious weeds, nutrients and organic matter are cycled and a yield results. By using coppiced willow (some of which are unwanted), hazel and other trees, something that is otherwise problematic is put to excellent use. In using woodchip in efficient systems, the mycorrhizal process produces highly nutritious compost. </p>
<p><strong>Integrate rather than segregate: </strong>By putting the right things in the right place, relationships develop between them and they support each other.</p>
<p>Choosing the right place for each compost system, in relation to it's use and functions means that they can function all the better and will not be problematic. Placing systems in the correct zones means that they are more likely to be maintained and used effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Use and value diversity: </strong>Diversity reduces vulnerability to a variety of threats and takes advantage of the unique nature of the environment in which it resides.</p>
<p>By using a variety of systems, we will produce a variety of composts, with different properties for different uses. We will be supporting a diverse flora and fauna, which in turn will support the wider environment, such as the parks and gardens beyond the site.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c3">Ethics</h2>
<p><strong>Earth Care<br></strong>Earth Care is very much at the forefront of this design. The soil of this ex-council nursery has been depleted but can be regenerated through the introduction of large amounts of compost, and the resulting increased biodiversity. The following practices are also in line with Earth Care;</p>
<ul>
<li data-list="bullet">reducing use of bought in compost </li>
<li data-list="bullet">not using peat-based composts</li>
<li data-list="bullet">using only organic methods (no synthetic fertilisers or herbicides)</li>
<li data-list="bullet">cycling nutrients effectively</li>
<li data-list="bullet">providing excellent habitat for microorganisms</li>
<li data-list="bullet">providing a diverse food source for birds and invertebrates</li>
<li data-list="bullet">making use of waste materials</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>People Care and Fair Share<br></strong>This design will support the broader project, for which people care and fair share are integral. <strong><br><br></strong></p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1flbmf52m5c4">Reflection</h2>
<p>My reflection document can be found <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Compost Reflection.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I'm sorry, I was a bit hyper at the prospect of finishing my fifth design. It means I'm nearly kinda halfway through.</p>
<p>I would also say that as I did this documentation retrospectively it meant that I saw the project and the design process from a different perspective. I can now see that the way I presented my design ideas to my employers was far from ideal as I used Miro. Presenting in this format is much better and in future I would try to present a completed design. I'd also make sure that planning and design time was included in any job spec.</p>
<p>My tutor wanted me to write something about why I think the solutions fit the goals well. </p>
<ul>
<li>make enough compost to meet needs on site to be community sufficient <span style="color: #ff00ff;">I don't know if this sufficient compost would have been made, but this would have been assessed after a couple of years and the production could have been ramped up! </span></li>
<li>close the loop of organic material being wasted/processed inefficiently <span style="color: #ff00ff;">This would certainly have been achieved</span></li>
<li>create low maintenance systems <span style="color: #ff00ff;">If the designs were followed, using the same materials I'd chosen, then they would have lasted a good long time and remained fairly low maintenance</span></li>
<li>make sure that weeds are composted effectively so that weed seed and roots are killed in the process <span style="color: #ff00ff;">The compost systems I chose should have dealt with the weeds effectively</span></li>
<li>design durable systems - sustainability is met through implementation of ethics <span style="color: #ff00ff;">I chose materials that would last as long possible, so I believe that this goal would have been met. </span></li>
<li>place systems where they are needed <span style="color: #ff00ff;">I am happy with where I placed each system, but without seeing them in place, I can't say exactly how effective they were. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">One shortcoming of my design was that I didn't include a plan for roles, how people were involved, and how to train people, so with hindsight, I think that this really should have been included, and put in the implementation plan. In the future, I would definitely do this, rather than just saying I would include it in another design. I think that was a bit of a cop out. Tsk tsk.</span></p>
<p>You made it this far. Thank you very much. You are richly rewarded with a joke;</p>
<p>Q. What is Mozart doing now?</p>
<p>A. Decomposing.</p>

<p>As a means to dealing with various health issues, I decided to create a design that would help me navigate my way through chronic pain, and all consequences of this. I started it in January 2020, when I was suffering from a frozen shoulder. Healing is a slow process. The design has evolved and I have re-worked it where I felt it would help me in my current state of health.</p>
</td>

</table>
<p> </p>
<p>This design process was a very personal one. I wouldn't want to put anyone through having to read it, other than the assessors - they're getting paid.</p>
<p>So if you're interested, I've whittled it down into a little presentation that you can watch.</p>

<p>For the Diploma in Applied Permaculture Design, I must complete ten designs. In order to facilitate this process, I have created an Action Learning Pathway, and this is the design for it. It is a map of my learning intentions/aspirations and an exploration into why I am doing the diploma and what I hope to gain from it.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkfls6sfaf">Vision</h2>
<p><strong>Allow yourself to dream and create goals<br></strong></p>
<p>I used this anchor point to think about what I hoped to gain from doing the diploma and also more broadly about how I want to live my life.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkubjiie4al">The Give Back Generation</h3>
<p>I have been resistant to putting this into the world, because it may seem a bit worthy, but it really is at the core of my diploma and my life. Permaculture to me is Buddhist practice put into practice! It's about Earth Care, People Care and Fair share, all ethics that fit within the teachings of the Buddha, but with Permaculture they have practical application. The Give Back Generation is about recognising that you already have enough, and that it's time to give back. My teacher Burgs explains it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6efbgmPEmk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
<p>I wrote a timeline of my life, and then used this to create a 'river of life' drawing'. Sounds a bit hippy to me but it's a real permaculture tradition. I did enjoy seeing the representation of my life on paper. It is too personal to share here, and the past is the past. Suffice to say, like everyone. I've had my ups and downs. It helped me to see the different phases of my life and to see that I am now in a phase where I take responsibility for my own actions and would like to make a conscious effort to shape my life into the best it can be.  'Energy flows where attention goes' and I would like to use my diploma to channel my attention into the things that really matter, to put some really good bends in the river and manage any upcoming rapids so that they don't capsize me. That's enough of that metaphor. </p>
<p>To get an idea of where I am at now, have a look at my <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/permaculture-cv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Permaculture CV.</a></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkubjiie4am">Values</h3>
<p>I did an exercise on identifying ones personal values, as part of a <a href="https://www.richardperkins.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard Perkins</a> course. <br>The completed from is <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/Personal Values Clarification Exercise.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> but to summarise, the ten values that scored the highest are shown below;</p>

<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkubjiie4an">Aspirations</h3>
<p>I have given some thought to how I want to live my life. I hope to;</p>
<ul>
<li>live lightly</li>
<li>develop my connection to nature</li>
<li>nurture relationships</li>
<li>let go of that which doesn't serve me</li>
<li>give back</li>
<li>be happy</li>
<li>nurture creativity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkg6vu521qk">Aims</h3>
<p>I would like to finish the diploma with a deep understanding of a wide range of permaculture frameworks, processes, tools and approaches.</p>
<p>I'd like to get to the stage where I can incorporate these into my garden design work, my business, my relationships and all aspects of my life.</p>
<p>I would like to create a portfolio that has a diverse range of applications, such as land stewardship, health and wellbeing, community development etc. However, my main focus will be land stewardship.</p>
<p>Community is often at the heart of permaculture projects. I must say that this is something that I find very challenging but I am always drawn to community projects. I hope to find solutions for this aspect of my work. </p>
<p>I hope to complete my accreditation in August 2022. </p>
<p>I would like to create a portfolio of designs that help me with my aspirations as a Buddhist.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkfoqf2uqo">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>I will create a diverse portfolio of designs</li>
<li>All my designs will fit in with my aspirations </li>
<li>I will complete my diploma by August 2022</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkg5sapt1q4">Helps</h2>
<p><strong>Identify the things that are going to help</strong></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkfoqf2vqq">Internal resources</h3>
<p>I did a skills audit, using the s<span style="color: #000000;">kills tree tool. Unfortunately, I spilt tea on the document so I'm in two minds as to whether or not to put pictures of them on here. But just to give you an idea, they provided me with a visual representation of my skills set. I could see the gaps, and in the future I could use them to identify which of those gaps I would like to fill. <br>I scored highest in the following areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Working precisely with instruments, tools, food</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">'Green fingers', garden skills</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Imagining, inventing, creating, designing</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Funnily enough, I scored zero on the 'analysing, breaking sown into parts' section. I think I can revisit the skills tree when I've completed my diploma, as then my analytical skills should be much improved!</span><br><br></p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1fkfoqf2vqr">External resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>Office space</li>
<li>Diploma Forum – weekly/monthly online meetings for six-week blocks – sign up if stuck</li>
<li>Guild – weekly online meetings with a small group of diploma students, sharing designs, check-ins and commitments</li>
<li>Regular tutorials and catch ups with tutor Carla</li>
<li>Bradford Area Permaculture Women group</li>
<li>Diploma Facebook group – I can ask a question for clarification on any point and am pretty much guaranteed an answer.</li>
<li>Supportive partner</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Networks</strong></p>

<p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>
<p>My biggest inspirations are nature and the teachings of my meditation teacher <a href="https://theartofmeditation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burgs.</a><br>Specific to permaculture, I gain a lot of inspiration from seeing posts from people on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bekindtoworms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, I follow a lot of permaculture people and hashtags.</p>
<p>I also love attending permaculture events and hearing about other student's design work via forums, the guild I'm part of and accreditation events. I have a small group of friends who live in my area who are into permaculture and they are all very inspiring. I have tried organising in-person meet-ups but it's like herding cats.</p>
<p>I would like to explore the work of <a href="https://www.joannamacy.net/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joanna Macy</a> further.<br><br></p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkfoqf2vqs">Limits</h2>
<p><strong>What might block the way, slow me down, or keep it small?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at other people’s designs and feeling inadequate</li>
<li>Getting a job and not having enough time to work on designs</li>
<li>Not looking at things objectively when I get stuck</li>
<li>Having quite a chaotic thought process that takes me off on tangents</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkfoqf2vqv">Patterns</h2>
<p><strong>Identify helpful and unhelpful patterns<br></strong>I haven't indicated which of the following patterns are helpful and which are unhelpful, because they can all be either. The best approach for me is to be aware of these habits and utilise them to my own benefit. <strong><br></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I obsess over details <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Excellent, details are important at times. But when focussing on details becomes a way of procrastinating, a tight deadline prevents me from getting waylaid.</span></li>
<li>I am a perfectionist <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Excellent, perfection is important at times. But when wanting perfection becomes a way of procrastinating, the phrase 'good enough is good enough' is useful.</span></li>
<li>I am non-linear in my thinking so bounce around with different ideas and go off on tangents <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Miro is great for this, I can put all my thoughts in an appropriate place.</span></li>
<li>When I am determined and motivated, I can chip away at something and stay focussed <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Flow is a lovely state to be in, but difficult to get back into once it's broken. I will keep phone on silent and stay off social media when studying. </span></li>
<li>I work well with short deadlines (I rock the lastminute.com method) and structure <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Keep the timeline as a guide but work realistically and with self-compassion</span></li>
<li>I am a visual learner <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Miro! Pinterest! Website! </span></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2018 I completed the RHS Level 3 Diploma in Applied Horticulture with distinction. I also have a BA honours degree. So I know I can study and I know how I study; I leave things to the last moment and then work fixatedly. </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkg4v7c61mj">Ideas</h2>
<p><strong>Gather inspirations</strong></p>
<p>I had lots of ideas, so I made an epic <a href="https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/the-life-of-jessie-d3f48d1cc99c4fd5e20677353d136868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mindmap</a>. </p>
<p>I came up with a lot of design ideas</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/wordcloud.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/wordcloud-xs.png 300w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/wordcloud-sm.png 480w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/wordcloud-md.png 768w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/wordcloud-lg.png 1024w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/wordcloud-xl.png 1360w ,https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/13/responsive/wordcloud-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="839" height="816"></figure>

<p>Then life happened and the list changed. </p>
<p>The list is morphing all the time, but the latest version is as follows;</p>
<ol>
<li>Action Learning Pathway</li>
<li>Portfolio Presentation </li>
<li>Kitchen Garden</li>
<li>Being Well</li>
<li>Community Structure</li>
<li>Whole-site fertility design</li>
<li>Food forest</li>
<li>Bird's garden</li>
<li>Jud &amp; Brian support</li>
<li>Benji</li>
<li>Liking where I live</li>
<li>Fairview Court garden</li>
<li>Gardening business design</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, that's more than ten. </p>
<p>I don't want to fix which designs I'm going to do because as I complete the designs, I will start to see where I need to develop my skills and I can choose designs that serve that need.</p>

<p>All the designs are connected in many ways, some support all of the others, earlier ones support those that follow, as I develop my learning.

<p>Make mistakes, start slow and small and tweak away. I tried using a Gantt chart but it was too complicated, so I used a basic chart. Maybe this will turn out to be too basic but it’s an experiment.</p>
<p>Design for catastrophe – what if I have to get a full-time job and can’t find time to do my designs? How do I design for that? Having an ALP gives me a road map through my diploma, so I will already have assessed the risks, challenges etc.</p>
<p>First things first; doing the ALP before doing any more designs is setting a strong foundation for the rest of my diploma. Yay!</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkg4v7c61ml">Ethics</h2>
<p><strong>People Care</strong> is met because I am designing a life for myself that is fulfilling, healthy and compassionate. As my core aim is to be part of the Give Back Generation, care for other people is integral to the design.</p>
<p><strong>Earth Care </strong>is met because part of being in the Give Back Generation is to tread lightly, to reduce what I take out. Working with a deep connection with nature is integral to this.</p>
<p><strong>Future Care </strong>is met because, as part of the Give Back Generation, I will be taking out less and hopefully having a positive effect on the future of the planet.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkg4v7c61mn">Action</h2>
<p><strong>Make a plan for getting it all done</strong></p>
<p>I created an action timeline and included significant dates and the following (and many more items);</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-work old blog to present the portfolio</li>
<li>Use Instagram to document diploma process</li>
<li>Set up reminders in Google calendar</li>
<li>Weekly check-ins with the FB group</li>
<li>Weekly guild meetings</li>
<li>Join forum if needed</li>
<li>Attend diploma Monthly Online Gatherings hosted by the Permaculture Association</li>
<li>Get a buddy </li>
<li>Create a tool that facilitates the decision process for which designs go into final portfolio</li>
<li>Use assessment forms and criteria to make sure that I'm on track</li>
</ul>
<p>The timeline can be seen <span style="color: #ba372a;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pzxJxML-l07zc-fGJ2L5DPVGtJDU7eps/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=117411403296018430536&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a><br><span style="color: #000000;">I kept this very flexible. Marking items as complete is great motivation for me.</span><br></span></p>
<p>I have created a <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KWXsR3EoeN0tlEEF1f1dgabsfwQPbXC_/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=117411403296018430536&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Selection tool</a><br><span style="color: #000000;">I have used this for each design I've considered and will include them in the presentation of each design, so that my thinking behind their inclusion can be seen.</span><br></span></p>
<p>I modified the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FYPoP-SHwikPJGp4n9rRR6MiKC5XVHxq/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=117411403296018430536&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matrix</a> form that was given to me by my tutor. It helps me to keep track of which tools, frameworks, principles etc. I have used, and to see any gaps. This will mean that my learning is diverse. <br>It's a great visual tool and I find it satisfying.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkg5nl341pu">Momentum</h2>
<p><strong>Consider how to keep going</strong></p>
<p>I drew up a draft of this design, with a timeline, and then duly forgot about it. However, over the months I was working on designs and ticking other boxes, such as using networks etc. I just wasn't following the timeline.</p>
<p>Now that I've left it all rather close to the deadline, I have all the momentum I need. This is just how I work. </p>
<p>I have reworked the timeline and I now update it regularly.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkg5nl341pv">Appreciation</h2>
<p><strong>Focus on things to be thankful for</strong></p>
<p>I am very grateful to my tutor Carla. She's awesome. She has kept me on track, has reminded me to look at criteria etc, pointed me towards other resources/support, and has been an inspiring, balanced and thoughtful guide. She might complain about the length of that sentence. I won't blame her, it's horrendous. </p>
<p>The guild that I'm, which I like to call the Get Shit Done Club, is just lovely. It's made up of people with integrity, humour, compassion and honesty. They have been a huge support to me in this process. We have shared designs, talked through design processes, challenges and ideas.  We've also shared a lot of laughter. I would not have met these fabulous people if I weren't doing the diploma. </p>
<p>I am very grateful to Killian who when I met him said that permaculture was just 'herb spirals and wafting about with willow'. Now he wants to study it. He has been a great asset as another pair of eyes, providing insightful observations and ideas. And he was crucial to the <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/portfoliopresentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portfolio Presentation</a> design</p>
<p>I am hugely grateful to the Permaculture Association for hosting this course. When are they going to set up a degree in Permaculture? That's what I want to know!</p>

<p>That is an extreme misquote, I didn't say that at all.</p>

<td style="width: 25%;">I think that these are quite clear. I am happy with them</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I struggle to understand what the difference is between goals, aims and objectives. I think that I have managed to use them correctly in this design.</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">As I haven't really addressed the aim about community within the design, this is something I could go back to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 25%;">Tools</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I feel as though I am getting better at knowing which tool to use for a task. Creating my own was really cool and it worked well.  Developing the matrix to suit my needs was helpful and I've shared it with other diploma students who have found it helpful.</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I do struggle with the concept of a 'river of life' because it seems a bit self-indulgent. However, reflecting on my life was very useful for the design process. </td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I would like to create a diagram that links all the designs up - showing how they connect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 25%;">Framework</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">Having struggled with the Design Web previously, I got to know it better through this design. </td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I struggled to figure out what design aspects went where. I don't know where survey, analysis, design decisions or implementation go. These are required for assessment.</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">When I use it again, I will follow the books's advice a bit more closely</td>

<tr>
<td style="width: 25%;">Ethics</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I feel that because of my aspirations, the ethics underpin this design strongly</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I don't like to write too much, so I'm not sure how well I have explained how the ethics affect this design</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I would like to bring the ethics in nearer to the beginning of the design process next time</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 25%;">Principles</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I liked Starhawk's principles as they're nice and simple. </td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I still feel as though they're a bit shoe-horned in. I think that they're in my thinking from the start but not particularly consciously.</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">To bring principles in near the start of future designs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 25%;">Vision</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I really like this part of the design web. Hopes and dreams may sound wishy-washy, but if we only think small, we will never get anywhere near reaching our potential</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I was hesitant to share my vision, but actually, it is so integral to the design that I couldn't leave it out. And although it's personal, I want to share it, because it is powerful.</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I'd like to include this in every design I do. Dream big and then see what can become of those dreams</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 25%;">Analysis</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">By identifying my needs, I was able to come up with some great solutions. This may seem obvious, but the process made me think things through in a methodical way, highlighting things that I wouldn't have considered. </td>

<td style="width: 25%;">Reflection</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">The Thinking Hats tool is my new favourite tool. It worked really well as a way of seeing my design through different perspectives. </td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I still find the definition of evaluation and reflection a little unclear, but perhaps that is because I've used the Design Web, and Evaluation isn't an anchor point.</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">I will use a framework that includes both Reflection and Evaluation so that I can get to grips with the differences.</td>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1fkg5nl341q1">Pause</h2>
<p><strong>Incorporate time for rest and rejuvenation</strong></p>
<p>My favourite tool for this part is Strictly Come Dancing videos on Youtube. I have a cup of tea and watch until I feel rejuvenated.<br>Please vote for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QejOzrlovTQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rose</a>. </p>
<p>I have also timetabled in visits to meet up with friends and not talk about permaculture. </p>
<p>I spend at least an hour outside everyday, and meditate most mornings. So twelve hours at my computer is fine, right? </p>
<p>Cake is off the menu just now - see the <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/beingwell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Being Well </a>design...</p>

<p><strong>Evaluate progress</strong></p>
<p>In the process of writing this design, I did quite a bit of waffly evaluation, which I won't subject anyone to. So I'm going to use the <a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/De Bono's Thinking Hats.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">De Bono's Thinking Hats</a> tool to summarise.</p>

<p>I'd like to look at each design I've chosen and see how they correlate with my overall objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li>live lightly</li>
<li>develop my connection to nature</li>
<li>nurture relationships</li>
<li>let go of that which doesn't serve me</li>
<li>give back</li>
<li>be happy</li>
<li>nurture creativity</li>
</ul>
<p>Design 1. Portfolio Presentation<br>This facilitates the presentation and creation of my permaculture diploma so indirectly, it meets all of my aspirations. It directly meets my aspiration to nurture creativity and to give back. And it did make me very happy!</p>
<p>Design 2. Kitchen Garden <br>My aspiration to develop my connection with nature is met by this design. The process nurtured my creativity and had it been implemented, would have helped me meet the others. Funnily enough, the process did help me 'let go of that which doesn't serve me', because I realised that the project wasn't for me and I needed to walk away from it.</p>
<p>Design 3. Action Learning Pathway<br>As per my first design, this one supports all of my aspirations, rather than meeting them directly. The aspiration to nurture creativity was met directly though.</p>
<p>Design 4. Being Well<br>'Letting go of that which doesn't serve me' was the main focus of this design. developing my connection to nature was an important factor too and my other aspirations were supported by it indirectly.</p>
<p>Design 5. Compost<br>The key aspiration for this design was to 'give back'. Giving back to the soil, regenerating soil life and soil structure - this is very important to me and it's important to remember that giving back isn't just about helping humans.<br><br>Although none of the designs will directly meet all of my aspirations, they should all meet at least one of them, support them all indirectly and definitely not hinder them in any way.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1foq7aitk6r">Tweak</h2>
<p>I have just hit an impasse with my next design, and I realised that I don't have anything in my ALP about what to do if this happens. I would like to make a flowchart so that I have a process for this situation, to avoid having a big delay and getting behind schedule.</p>

<p>I will return to this design throughout the process of creating my final five designs, so there may well be a ALP part two!</p>
<p>Here's a picture of one of my heroes, Miriam Margolyes. Because why the heck not.</p>
<p>May all beings be happy and peaceful.</p>
