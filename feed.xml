<p>For this design, I decided to use Rosemary Morrow’s principles, because they seem to fit quite nicely. They are in her book, listed below. I haven’t included them all, as some are irrelevant, and as this is quite a quick design process, I am keeping it to the ones that are the most pertinent. In the second phase I used a select few of Holmgren’s principles</p>

<figure>For phase one I used SADIMET, which is kinda linear (but doesn't have to be). When it came to phase two, I realised I wanted to use a nonlinear framework, so I switched to Looby's Design Web. To demonstrate this, I used Miro. You can check it out <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lfsbkfg=/?share_link_id=385523446665" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and watch the video below to see how to navigate Miro, if you're not familiar with it.</figure>
<p>But if you want to just look at the slide show, scroll on. See how good I am to you? You are very welcome.</p>

<p>I don't explain all the slides in the video, so you can pause it as and when. <br>I will be adding the design here in the body of this web page at some point, as the video was really just to show how to navigate Miro.</p>

                <p>My sixth design was about boundaries. It was very personal, so I'm not sharing it in full, but here are a few little snippets.</p>
<p>The design was very useful  as a support for a difficult situation. It provided a framework for making decisions and it was a bit of emergency Permaculture at times! I learned a lot about myself and it helped me think deeply about what I am willing to tolerate, and the strength of one's desires to blind you to the truth of a situation.</p>
<p>It was a good step towards designing collaboratively with my partner. We worked together on two of my other designs that followed after this one.  </p>
<p>The best tool I used was the Circle of Control. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘When we spend our time acting in the wider circle of concern, worrying, generating fear and playing out disaster scenarios of what could happen, we use up available energy that could be spent in our circle of influence. Our circle of influence shrinks as a result of lack of attention and energy and also because the energy spent in worrying disempowers us.</p>
<p>In contrast, when our energy is spent in our circle of influence it expands and we become able to tackle some of the issues that were previously out of reach’</p>
<p>~Looby Macnamara</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is the diagram that I created to visualise my Circle of Control;</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I remember being asked by the guy in the job centre when I was 17, where I saw myself in five years’ time!! Hilarious, given that within a year I’d be in a cult, and wouldn’t leave for another six years!</p>
<p>Well, I am asking myself where I’d like to be in five years’ time now. In 10 years’ time, I’d like to be living on the land, with some good folk, fellow guardians of the land. I’d like to be shit-hot at growing food and be skilled in other practical stuff – preserving, cooking, foraging etc. I’d like to have zero carbon footprint. In five years’ time, I’d like to be well on my way to being skilled up. And I’d like to be ridiculously happy. Actually, the latter is the most important…</p>
<p>I would like to do a design that is about how to earn money/get by, perhaps on a system that is not about money…How about being community sufficient? I would like to live in close harmony with the land. At the moment, I live in a second floor flat in Baildon, on the edge of Shipley. It is very much an urban situation. It's quite a far call from where I'd like to be, but **INSERT PRINCIPLE HERE!**</p>
<p>I feel anxious about this endeavour, as though I need to be out there already, learning. I am worried that I should be getting on with looking for a placement…but I am here, now. Perhaps it would be good to enjoy a year working on my diploma, get a part time job, enjoy the allotment, wait for Covid to pass – if it will…sit out the storm. As Burgs said, now is not the time to be venturing forth into new things…chill, make a full recovery from the frozen shoulder and use the time wisely. Get fit again. Look at the list of skills I’d like to acquire and see if I can do any from where I am now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In re-writing it, I felt that I wanted to change the framework, as it's an ongoing design. </p>

                <p><strong>Building Resilience; Uncertainty in Uncertain Times</strong></p>
<p>I have heard people say that Permaculture is not good at helping people to make decisions. That has not been my experience. But then again, I do make some 'bad' decisions. I have learnt more from my mistakes than from my successes, that is for sure, so does it even matter? Permaculture design has helped me make decisions and plans, but mostly, it has provided me with a way of looking at the bigger picture, aligning it with what I value most, and keeping on track with that. </p>
<p>I started out wanting a straightforward framework that I could follow step-by-step. I wanted a Wikihow on Permaculture design. But it began to dawn on me that designing doesn't really work best like that, for me anyway. We are told that when you begin designing, you must do your survey first - yes, you will come up with ideas, but try not to be drawn into them, until the right time. I don't think that is realistic, and I don't think it is at all necessary. By the time I'd got a bit more than halfway with my ten designs, I realised that trying to fit the process into some regimented system was sapping the creativity from me, and restricting my vision. And then the glorious disruption from Dan Palmer and his friend Carol Sanford took me into what Dan refers to as the 'bewildering fertility of the void'. I applied some of their frameworks and tools in my final designs and realised that as far as I'd come with my learning, I didn't really know anything.</p>
<p>Designing is (shock horror) messy. Which is why I love Miro so much, because I can store all my disparate thoughts on it and come back to them when the time is right.</p>
<p>I started my Regenerative Life design in order to create a plan for how I would earn a living whilst remaining true to my aspirations as a Buddhist. I did the design, I had some ideas, we actioned the design, but I still don't know what I'm doing. Ah, the bewildering fertility of the void! </p>
<p>When I started these studies, I thought I'd be learning how to draw really good maps, how to use a bunyip, how to analyse functions, systems and elements, and all that jazz. And of course, I have done that sort of thing, but more importantly, I've realised my shortcomings with regards to communication, to wanting to be in control, to my own rigid thinking. A resilient mind is an open and flexible mind. </p>
<p>Not only that, but when I talk about People Care, Earth Care and Fair Share, I have to really care, and be willing to share. Through the various projects that I have worked on, I have seen how the ethics, and the word 'community' are bandied about. Which leads me to...</p>
<p><strong>Personal, People, Place</strong></p>
<p>I shared my Community Gardens People design in Carla Moss's <a href="https://www.permaculture.org.uk/user/5068/carla-moss/diploma-tutor-profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum</a> and received lots of good advice, but I didn't have time to heed their advice. I then duly forgot about it, as I hadn't done the reflection - probably due to aversion to looking at the project any more, and then got drawn into a whole other story, where all that advice would have served me very nicely. I got back into my pattern! It wasn't until I came to writing up the design that I saw how I might have avoided those pitfalls. I did then put some of the advice to use in the next community situation.</p>
<p>I realised during the Community Gardens design that I wanted to work collaboratively on future designs, so I did with two designs after that. This was particularly successful in my Growing Brookside design, when I collaborated with my partner Killian. Having a different perspective and another brain to work with was a huge benefit. I felt supported, especially as I began to feel overwhelmed by the design, and he learnt a lot about the Permaculture process. </p>
<p>Having a body of work to look back on means that I can see my learning clearly; the patterns, the areas I need to work on in myself, to come to terms with aspects of my character and also, where to set boundaries, and how to make decisions about projects I want to get involved with in the future. I am learning so much about myself.</p>
<p>Doing zone 00 stuff is really important, because people work is really challenging, but it's the most crucial part to learn. Without other people, without being able to work with others, to listen and to respond compassionately, there's no point doing any other type of work. A land design will fall apart if the people working on it can't work together. This reminds me of the nested wholes of the Living Systems work - I am nested within a community that is nested within the land, and all three need to be in harmony for all to thrive. </p>
<p>I probably have more questions now than when I started. Does it really matter if a project doesn't have a plan? Does a Permaculture design really help a project? Is the time invested worthwhile? Afterall, as I stated previously, mistakes are the best way to learn. I suspect that it is better to have a design that doesn't work out than to not have a design at all. Because the number of designs that are implemented exactly according to plans are as rare as hens teeth. </p>
<p>We can be in the moment when we design, and this allows us to be completely in the moment when we action the design, because we have a well-thought out plan that supports the flow of the project. </p>
<p>I feel as though the Permaculture diploma has shaped my life, and Permaculture itself has been an excellent tool for this. The Regenerative Life design was in the background throughout, and each design has led me through a learning process - through projects that didn't turn out how I thought they would but that gave me incredible learning, and I think that because I was designing my way through, I was more open to the learning. And it seems as though it has all culminated in design ten, which has been positively received by the clients, and we have found a place to be where we can meet the goals we set in the Regenerative Life design.</p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1g3t65tug6u" dir="auto">Day one 21/05/22</h2>
<div dir="auto">Today was day one of 100 days of Permaculture!!!</div>
<div dir="auto">I’ve been working on my Diploma in Applied Permaculture since 2019, and I’m halfway through. I’ve got to raise my game as I’ve just been given the go ahead to do my accreditation event at this year’s National Permaculture Gathering. Yoiks! So, to keep up the momentum, I’m going to do a 100 day challenge. I’ll be posting every day, until the event. There’s more than 100 days but I’m off on retreat, but I can still fit in 100).</div>
<div dir="auto">Luckily, I’m at a lovely farm @Brookside.eco.farm where Permaculture is very much embraced, and it looks as though we might be staying! I’ll be doing at least one design for them, there’s lots of exciting stuff happening!</div>
<div dir="auto">These pictures are of the incredible WET system they had installed. It cleans all the grey and brown water from the main buildings, as it passes through five ponds. The water is cleaned by diverse range of trees and perennials, many of which provide food or other uses. By the fifth pond, it’s clean enough to swim in!</div>
<div dir="auto">Not only that, walking through it is heavenly.</div>
<div dir="auto">Also, Benji has become a reluctant member of a pack of four dogs, this is Trewa. It was quite a challenge to get a shot of them together.</div>
<div dir="auto">Today I finished the amendments for my first five designs. I’m taking on a big challenge, but I’m going to give it everything I’ve got. I hope you’ll enjoy following my progress-wish me luck!!</div>
