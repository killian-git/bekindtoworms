                <p>When I started my diploma, I wanted to know what fitted where; 'is this bit analysis, or is it part of the survey still?', 'is this evaluation, or is it reflection?'. I wanted frameworks that were straightforward, linear. I heeded the caution of some not to jump ahead to coming up with ideas, until you'd done your survey. I couldn't get my head around nonlinear frameworks, didn't know where things fitted. At about design fiveish, I thought I was getting the hang of it. Then somewhere in the swirling, overlapping blur of designs that followed, I happened upon the work of Dan Palmer and his Making Permaculture Stronger podcast. And through that, I stumbled upon the wonderful, unsettling work of Carol Sanford. I started to realise that designing is, without a doubt, nonlinear. I had to accept that what I had learnt so far was a really just a good basis for exploring designs that didn't always, if ever, follow rules.</p>
<p>It was an uncomfortable place to be and I was miffed. I wrote to Dan Palmer and told him so. I told him I didn't have time for these revelations, I had deadlines! He loved that and encouraged me to languish in the 'bewildering fertility of the void'. He thought perhaps we could do a podcast together and over a few emails, we had the merest hatchings of a plan for a podcast which would start; "In this episode, I interview a well-intentioned buffoon with more questions than answers" because that is pretty much how I described myself to him. </p>
<p>Yes, that well-intentioned buffoon with more questions than answers was me. Little old me. </p>
<p>Well, sadly, we will never make that podcast because Dan died as I was writing up my final design, which was profoundly influenced by him.</p>
<p>Dan has been a huge inspiration to me and I would like to dedicate my diploma to him. </p>
<p>I will continue to be bewildered, to question everything, to explore Living Design Systems and I will listen very, very carefully to Carol Sanford.</p>
<p>Blessings and heartfelt gratitude to you Dan, may you be at peace.</p>

<figure>For phase one I used SADIMET, which is kinda linear (but doesn't have to be). When it came to phase two, I realised I wanted to use a nonlinear framework, so I switched to Looby's Design Web. To demonstrate this, I used Miro. You can check it out <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lfsbkfg=/?share_link_id=385523446665" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and watch the video below to see how to navigate Miro, if you're not familiar with it.</figure>
<p>But if you want to just look at the slide show, scroll on. See how good I am to you? You are very welcome.</p>

                <p>My sixth design was about boundaries. It was very personal, so I'm not sharing it in full, but here are a few little snippets.</p>
<p>The design was very useful  as a support for a difficult situation. It provided a framework for making decisions and it was a bit of emergency Permaculture at times! I learned a lot about myself and it helped me think deeply about what I am willing to tolerate, and the strength of one's desires to blind you to the truth of a situation.</p>
<p>It was a good step towards designing collaboratively with my partner. We worked together on two of my other designs that followed after this one.  </p>
<p>The best tool I used was the Circle of Control. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘When we spend our time acting in the wider circle of concern, worrying, generating fear and playing out disaster scenarios of what could happen, we use up available energy that could be spent in our circle of influence. Our circle of influence shrinks as a result of lack of attention and energy and also because the energy spent in worrying disempowers us.</p>
<p>In contrast, when our energy is spent in our circle of influence it expands and we become able to tackle some of the issues that were previously out of reach’</p>
<p>~Looby Macnamara</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is the diagram that I created to visualise my Circle of Control;</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I remember being asked by the guy in the job centre when I was 17, where I saw myself in five years’ time!! Hilarious, given that within a year I’d be in a cult, and wouldn’t leave for another six years!</p>
<p>Well, I am asking myself where I’d like to be in five years’ time now. In 10 years’ time, I’d like to be living on the land, with some good folk, fellow guardians of the land. I’d like to be shit-hot at growing food and be skilled in other practical stuff – preserving, cooking, foraging etc. I’d like to have zero carbon footprint. In five years’ time, I’d like to be well on my way to being skilled up. And I’d like to be ridiculously happy. Actually, the latter is the most important…</p>
<p>I would like to do a design that is about how to earn money/get by, perhaps on a system that is not about money…How about being community sufficient? I would like to live in close harmony with the land. At the moment, I live in a second floor flat in Baildon, on the edge of Shipley. It is very much an urban situation. It's quite a far call from where I'd like to be, but **INSERT PRINCIPLE HERE!**</p>
<p>I feel anxious about this endeavour, as though I need to be out there already, learning. I am worried that I should be getting on with looking for a placement…but I am here, now. Perhaps it would be good to enjoy a year working on my diploma, get a part time job, enjoy the allotment, wait for Covid to pass – if it will…sit out the storm. As Burgs said, now is not the time to be venturing forth into new things…chill, make a full recovery from the frozen shoulder and use the time wisely. Get fit again. Look at the list of skills I’d like to acquire and see if I can do any from where I am now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In re-writing it, I felt that I wanted to change the framework, as it's an ongoing design. </p>
