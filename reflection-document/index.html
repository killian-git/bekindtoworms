I will identify and discuss the key things that I've learnt, looking at how the designs influenced my learning and each other. I'll go through the most significant realisations I had about the various tools, frameworks and resources that I used.</p><h2>Midpoint reflection</h2><p>Although officially I started in 2018, that year was completely taken up with the studentship I did with the RHS. Having said that, I didn’t really start work on it properly until 2020, when I joined the guild. The job at Wibsey (where I did the compost design) also spurred me on - the real need for practical solutions was a boon to my motivation.</p><p>I did lots of designs, or at least the bare bones of several designs that didn’t make it into the portfolio. They were an important part of my learning process. I did one about right livelihood, another about the structure of a large-scale community garden project, a cut flower garden design, two forest gardens and a design for the raised beds area at Wibsey, amongst others. But then when I came to document them, I realised that a lot of them had too many big gaps in, so they didn’t make the grade. This informed the first of my key learnings:</p><p><strong>The importance of being methodical<br></strong>I found that following the framework as closely as possible was helpful, although I did find that moving from one step to another that was out of sequence was necessary at times. This was especially true of times when I was struggling with the sequence and really needed to get the clarity that another step could provide, such as having goals/aims. This also helped when I was confused about just what goes under which heading, i.e. analysis.</p><p><strong>Tools are really awesome<br></strong>But you have to find the right one, and if you can’t find the right one, create a new one that fits the job.</p><p>As a gardener, I know when to use a fork and not a spade. When a saw is better than loppers. But with Permaculture design, sometimes the right tool isn’t completely obvious. I didn’t always know exactly what I was trying to do. So I modified tools. I started using SWOC, and changed it to SW. I used random assembly but modified it so that it also included notes and ideas that related to specific areas.</p><p>As someone who can tend to be a bit too self-critical, I found the reflection tools ‘Roses, Thorns and Buds’ and ‘De Bono’s Six Hats’ were very helpful. They forced my brain to use pathways that it’s not accustomed to, to consider things from different perspectives. How marvellous.</p><p><strong>They’re not You<br></strong>Ok, full disclosure; I’m not actually there yet with this one, but it’s wafting around in my psyche, so I think it’ll manifest at some point…So this is about designing with fixed ideas about how the design should be done, what the client needs and what they should get. The inspiration for this thinking came from a Brenna Quinlan Instagram post and as I read it, I started to hear a little voice (not literally) and a finger gently prodding me (that turned out to be my dog kicking me in his sleep), saying ‘you do that, that’s you that is’. Fair enough, hands up, I am stubborn and a bit too rigid in my thinking. So I’m off to TK Maxx to get myself a whole rainbow of hats. I’ll show that Bono character – six? Better make that ten! HA!<br><br><strong>Good enough is good enough<br></strong>Not usually something I’m particularly good at upholding, but when surveying I think it’s an important one. A lot of time and energy can be saved by really thinking through what is needed. And this is another reason why I think goal setting first is important because otherwise, you might overlook the need to survey some things and survey aspects that you didn’t need to. Going back to do things that you’ve missed off isn’t always possible.</p><p><strong>Presentation is Key<br></strong>Through the documentation process I realised that the way I presented some of my designs to people had a detrimental effect on the projects themselves. My fixation with Miro meant that I didn’t realise that not everyone loved it as much as me. Submitting designs that are only half done is also not helpful as people can’t see how the whole thing fits together. However, when time is short or you’re submitting speculative designs, or not getting paid, it’s hard to give get the balance right. I guess that’s something that comes with experience.</p><p><strong>Meta confusion<br></strong>Ok, so this bakes my noodle massively and it’s going ot be difficult to put into words, so please bear with me.<br>When I’m working on a design, I can start mixing up the actual design work with the design process. And when evaluating or reflecting (and don’t get me started on how the heck to tell those to heckin’ things apart) I can slide into thinking about the process rather than the design and not realise. It’s something that I struggle with but will probably click into place at some point. I hope.</p><p><strong>Other thoughts<br></strong>I wanted to use my diploma to find practical and/or holistic ways to find positive solutions and I feel as though I’ve done this to certain degree. Because they were done retrospectively, I feel as though sometimes they were a bit gappy. Not having implemented the two land designs meant that a lot of learning was missing and I feel that this is evident from the work presented. I would very much like to fill that gap in the final half of my diploma.<br><br><strong>Last thought<br></strong>Having completed my first five designs I am feeling much more confident in my understanding of permaculture design. So much so that I am finding it hard not to get stuck into the next five right away. I'm supposed to be having a breather though so they'll have to wait. Right?</p><p> </p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/tags/supporting-document/">supporting document</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p><p>Designed by Killian</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
