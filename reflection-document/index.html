I will identify and discuss the key things that I've learnt, looking at how the designs influenced my learning and each other. I'll go through the most significant realisations I had about the various tools, frameworks and resources that I used.</p><p>Joe Atkinson's video on writing up</p><p>26.10.21</p><p>Attended the PA MOG about tools and realised that I don’t use enough and I don’t know enough…</p><p>I’m struggling to understand what analysis is. I Googled the definition and that really helped because I saw that it's about breaking everything down into it's composite parts and seeing how they </p><p>Aranya says;</p><p>Analysis ~ this is the stage where we take all the information we have gathered and use the ethics, principles and appropriate design tools and methods to help us decide the best elements to choose and how best to connect them together into resilient low input, high output systems.</p><p><a href="https://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/what-permaculture-part-3-design">https://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/what-permaculture-part-3-design</a></p><p><strong>Portfolio Presentation design</strong></p><p>I had written some observations that were just free-form. Completing a self-interview made me think in a different way. I then looked back at my original notes and edited the interview to include those points, as they were valid.</p><p>Maybe this was just a long-winded way to make a decision, but the process taught me a lot about the permaculture design process.</p><p> </p><p>Getting frustrated with my Health design, I realised that this was ok because I was using the Design Web, and it's not a linear process. Moving from one anchor point to any other anchor point at any time is part of the framework's strength. I'm just not sure how to show this process in my documentation</p><p> </p><p>Something that I find really hard is differentiating the design process from the design itself, so when evaluating for example, I start talking about the design process, rather than the design. </p><p>I have utilised external support by sharing designs with Carla's forum groups - shared my health design and the community structure design</p><p> </p><p>For my ALP i think I need to include something about how I don't want the quality of my designs to be affected by being on a tight deadline. I am struggling to get to grips with Functions, Systems and elements, and so in my compost design there is a really good opportunity to learn a lot, and this will serve my other five designs well, so it's good to take the time now, even if it means I miss my deadline...Aaarrgh. </p><p>Also, I feel as though I am letting so much go in order to do this work, missing out on social stuff. Jud needs me and I'm not going to put her welfare behind this diploma.</p><p>The whole meta thing drives me potty. I can very easily slide into the meta in a design and start designing the design process. Is there a tool or something to help with this?</p><p>For example, I started doing my ALP and then i was evaluating the design process rather than the design - it's very easy to get these in a muddle</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/tags/supporting-document/">supporting document</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p><p>Designed by Killian</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
