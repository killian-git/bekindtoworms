I will identify and discuss the key things that I've learnt, looking at how the designs influenced my learning and each other. I'll go through the most significant realisations I had about the various tools, frameworks and resources that I used.</p><h2>Midpoint reflection</h2><p>Although officially I started in 2018, that year was completely taken up with the studentship I did with the RHS. Having said that, I didn’t really start work on it properly until 2020, when I joined the guild. The job at Wibsey (where I did the compost design) also spurred me on - the real need for practical solutions was a boon to my motivation.</p><p>I did lots of designs, or at least the bare bones of several designs that didn’t make it into the portfolio. They were an important part of my learning process. I did one about right livelihood, another about the structure of a large-scale community garden project, a cut flower garden design, two forest gardens and a design for the raised beds area at Wibsey, amongst others. But then when I came to document them, I realised that a lot of them had too many big gaps in, so they didn’t make the grade. This informed the first of my key learnings:</p><p><strong>The importance of being methodical<br></strong>I found that following the framework as closely as possible was helpful, although I did find that moving from one step to another that was out of sequence was necessary at times. This was especially true of times when I was struggling with the sequence and really needed to get the clarity that another step could provide, such as having goals/aims. This also helped when I was confused about just what goes under which heading, i.e. analysis.</p><p><strong>Tools are really awesome<br></strong>But you have to find the right one, and if you can’t find the right one, create a new one that fits the job.</p><p>As a gardener, I know when to use a fork and not a spade. When a saw is better than loppers. But with Permaculture design, sometimes the right tool isn’t completely obvious. I didn’t always know exactly what I was trying to do. So I modified tools. I started using SWOC, and changed it to SW. I used random assembly but modified it so that it also included notes and ideas that related to specific areas.</p><p>As someone who can tend to be a bit too self-critical, I found the reflection tools ‘Roses, Thorns and Buds’ and ‘De Bono’s Six Hats’ were very helpful. They forced my brain to use pathways that it’s not accustomed to, to consider things from different perspectives. How marvellous.</p><p><strong>They’re not You<br></strong>Ok, full disclosure; I’m not actually there yet with this one, but it’s wafting around in my psyche, so I think it’ll manifest at some point…So this is about designing with fixed ideas about how the design should be done, what the client needs and what they should get. The inspiration for this thinking came from a Brenna Quinlan Instagram post and as I read it, I started to hear a little voice (not literally) and a finger gently prodding me (that turned out to be my dog kicking me in his sleep), saying ‘you do that, that’s you that is’. Fair enough, hands up, I am stubborn and a bit too rigid in my thinking. So I’m off to TK Maxx to get myself a whole rainbow of hats. I’ll show that Bono character – six? Better make that ten! HA!<br><br><strong>Good enough is good enough<br></strong>Not usually something I’m particularly good at upholding, but when surveying I think it’s an important one. A lot of time and energy can be saved by really thinking through what is needed. And this is another reason why I think goal setting first is important because otherwise, you might overlook the need to survey some things and survey aspects that you didn’t need to. Going back to do things that you’ve missed off isn’t always possible.</p><p><strong>Presentation is Key<br></strong>Through the documentation process I realised that the way I presented some of my designs to people had a detrimental effect on the projects themselves. My fixation with Miro meant that I didn’t realise that not everyone loved it as much as me. Submitting designs that are only half done is also not helpful as people can’t see how the whole thing fits together. However, when time is short or you’re submitting speculative designs, or not getting paid, it’s hard to give get the balance right. I guess that’s something that comes with experience.</p><p><strong>Meta confusion<br></strong>Ok, so this bakes my noodle massively and it’s going ot be difficult to put into words, so please bear with me.<br>When I’m working on a design, I can start mixing up the actual design work with the design process. And when evaluating or reflecting (and don’t get me started on how the heck to tell those to heckin’ things apart) I can slide into thinking about the process rather than the design and not realise. It’s something that I struggle with but will probably click into place at some point. I hope.</p><p><strong>Other thoughts<br></strong>I wanted to use my diploma to find practical and/or holistic ways to find positive solutions and I feel as though I’ve done this to certain degree. Because they were done retrospectively, I feel as though sometimes they were a bit gappy. Not having implemented the two land designs meant that a lot of learning was missing and I feel that this is evident from the work presented. I would very much like to fill that gap in the final half of my diploma.<br><br><strong>Last thought<br></strong>Having completed my first five designs I am feeling much more confident in my understanding of permaculture design. So much so that I am finding it hard not to get stuck into the next five right away. I'm supposed to be having a breather though so they'll have to wait. Right?</p><h2><strong>Endpoint Reflection</strong></h2><p><strong>Building Resilience; Uncertainty in Uncertain Times</strong></p><p>I have heard people say that Permaculture is not good at helping people to make decisions. That has not been my experience. But then again, I do make some 'bad' decisions. I have learnt more from my mistakes than from my successes, that is for sure, so does it even matter? Permaculture design has helped me make decisions and plans, but mostly, it has provided me with a way of looking at the bigger picture, aligning it with what I value most, and keeping on track with that. </p><p>I started out wanting a straightforward framework that I could follow step-by-step. I wanted a Wikihow on Permaculture design. But it began to dawn on me that designing doesn't really work best like that, for me anyway. We are told that when you begin designing, you must do your survey first - yes, you will come up with ideas, but try not to be drawn into them, until the right time. I don't think that is realistic, and I don't think it is at all necessary. By the time I'd got a bit more than halfway with my ten designs, I realised that trying to fit the process into some regimented system was sapping the creativity from me, and restricting my vision. And then the glorious disruption from Dan Palmer and his friend Carol Sanford took me into what Dan refers to as the 'bewildering fertility of the void'. I applied some of their frameworks and tools in my final designs and realised that as far as I'd come with my learning, I didn't really know anything.</p><p>Designing is (shock horror) messy. Which is why I love Miro so much, because I can store all my disparate thoughts on it and come back to them when the time is right.</p><p>I started my Regenerative Life design in order to create a plan for how I would earn a living whilst remaining true to my aspirations as a Buddhist. I did the design, I had some ideas, we actioned the design, but I still don't know what I'm doing. Ah, the bewildering fertility of the void! </p><p>When I started these studies, I thought I'd be learning how to draw really good maps, how to use a bunyip, how to analyse functions, systems and elements, and all that jazz. And of course, I have done that sort of thing, but more importantly, I've realised my shortcomings with regards to communication, to wanting to be in control, to my own rigid thinking. A resilient mind is an open and flexible mind. </p><p>Not only that, but when I talk about People Care, Earth Care and Fair Share, I have to really care, and be willing to share. Through the various projects that I have worked on, I have seen how the ethics, and the word 'community' are bandied about. Which leads me to...</p><p><strong>Personal, People, Place</strong></p><p>I shared my Community Gardens People design in Carla Moss's <a href="https://www.permaculture.org.uk/user/5068/carla-moss/diploma-tutor-profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum</a> and received lots of good advice, but I didn't have time to heed their advice. I then duly forgot about it, as I hadn't done the reflection - probably due to aversion to looking at the project any more, and then got drawn into a whole other story, where all that advice would have served me very nicely. I got back into my pattern! It wasn't until I came to writing up the design that I saw how I might have avoided those pitfalls. I did then put some of the advice to use in the next community situation.</p><p>I realised during the Community Gardens design that I wanted to work collaboratively on future designs, so I did with two designs after that. This was particularly successful in my Growing Brookside design, when I collaborated with my partner Killian. Having a different perspective and another brain to work with was a huge benefit. I felt supported, especially as I began to feel overwhelmed by the design, and he learnt a lot about the Permaculture process. </p><p>Having a body of work to look back on means that I can see my learning clearly; the patterns, the areas I need to work on in myself, to come to terms with aspects of my character and also, where to set boundaries, and how to make decisions about projects I want to get involved with in the future. I am learning so much about myself.</p><p>Doing zone 00 stuff is really important, because people work is really challenging, but it's the most crucial part to learn. Without other people, without being able to work with others, to listen and to respond compassionately, there's no point doing any other type of work. A land design will fall apart if the people working on it can't work together. This reminds me of the nested wholes of the Living Systems work - I am nested within a community that is nested within the land, and all three need to be in harmony for all to thrive. </p><p>I probably have more questions now than when I started. Does it really matter if a project doesn't have a plan? Does a Permaculture design really help a project? Is the time invested worthwhile? Afterall, as I stated previously, mistakes are the best way to learn. I suspect that it is better to have a design that doesn't work out than to not have a design at all. Because the number of designs that are implemented exactly according to plans are as rare as hens teeth. </p><p>We can be in the moment when we design, and this allows us to be completely in the moment when we action the design, because we have a well-thought out plan that supports the flow of the project. </p><p>I feel as though the Permaculture diploma has shaped my life, and Permaculture itself has been an excellent tool for this. The Regenerative Life design was in the background throughout, and each design has led me through a learning process - through projects that didn't turn out how I thought they would but that gave me incredible learning, and I think that because I was designing my way through, I was more open to the learning. And it seems as though it has all culminated in design ten, which has been positively received by the clients, and we have found a place to be where we can meet the goals we set in the Regenerative Life design.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/tags/supporting-document/">supporting document</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p><p>Designed by Killian</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
