I decided to use materials that had the least ecological impact and to include elements that would benefit all aspects of the environment, where possible.</p><p>Local consultation was not possible, but I would hope that this would take place at some point, within the design of the larger project. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img loading="lazy" src="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/wide1920.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/wide1920-xs.jpg 300w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/wide1920-sm.jpg 480w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/wide1920-md.jpg 768w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/wide1920-lg.jpg 1024w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/wide1920-xl.jpg 1360w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/wide1920-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="494"><figcaption>Image: author's own.

I realised that in rushing ahead with ideas meant that I missed important steps out, steps that would have facilitated deeper thought processes. I went back over things where I could, but it was too late to make changes to the final design. To be fair to myself, the deadline was a tight one and I didn't really have time for much deliberation. Once I have completed the diploma, those processes should be well imbedded into my thought processes so that I use them automatically.</p><p><strong>How this design process has helped me<br></strong>It has helped me to see the process I would follow with sufficient time. Looking back at it now, it has made me think of other opportunities that are on the site, such as water catchment on a big scale, and incorporating rain gardens.</p><p id="mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1iv"><strong>What went well?<br></strong>I realised that I should have done a client interview. As it would have been like shutting the gate after the horse had bolted, I looked at the goal articulation and defined the functions from this. It was a bit of a bodge job, but it worked just fine. I was pleased that I had come up with a solution...a solution for a problem when looking for a solution for a solution...oh dear, I feel like I'm in the Matrix.</p><p id="mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j0"><strong>What was challenging?<br></strong>I thought that using a different framework, one that looked a bit simpler, would make the process easier. This wasn't the case. I think that my main difficulty is working out which elements go under which headings, and that is just something that will become clearer as I progress through the diploma. </p><p>There wasn't enough time for prolonged observation</p><p id="mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j1"><strong>Long term vision and goals<br></strong></p><p>The long term vision is that this kitchen garden is part of a bigger community garden that is able to sustain itself financially.</p><p id="mcetoc_1fk2st9eq1j2"><strong>Next achievable steps</strong></p><p>This project is now on hold, so there are no next achievable steps.</p><p> </p><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img loading="lazy" src="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/Benji1920.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-xs.jpg 300w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-sm.jpg 480w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-md.jpg 768w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-lg.jpg 1024w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-xl.jpg 1360w, https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/media/posts/10/responsive/Benji1920-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="" width="1920" height="658"><figcaption>Fauna was difficult to assess, but glimpses of this interesting chap are fairly common</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/tags/permaculture-design/">permaculture design</a></li></ul></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
