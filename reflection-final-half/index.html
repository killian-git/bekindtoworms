That has not been my experience. But then again, I do make some 'bad' decisions. I have learnt more from my mistakes than from my successes, that is for sure, so does it even matter? Permaculture design has helped me make decisions and plans, but mostly, it has provided me with a way of looking at the bigger picture, aligning it with what I value most, and keeping on track with that. </p><p>I started out wanting a straightforward framework that I could follow step-by-step. I wanted a Wikihow on Permaculture design. But it began to dawn on me that designing doesn't really work best like that, for me anyway. We are told that when you begin designing, you must do your survey first - yes, you will come up with ideas, but try not to be drawn into them, until the right time. I don't think that is realistic, and I don't think it is at all necessary. By the time I'd got a bit more than halfway with my ten designs, I realised that trying to fit the process into some regimented system was sapping the creativity from me, and restricting my vision. And then the glorious disruption from Dan Palmer and his friend Carol Sanford took me into what Dan refers to as the 'bewildering fertility of the void'. I applied some of their frameworks and tools in my final designs and realised that as far as I'd come with my learning, I didn't really know anything.</p><p>Designing is (shock horror) messy. Which is why I love Miro so much, because I can store all my disparate thoughts on it and come back to them when the time is right.</p><p>I started my Regenerative Life design in order to create a plan for how I would earn a living whilst remaining true to my aspirations as a Buddhist. I did the design, I had some ideas, we actioned the design, but I still don't know what I'm doing. Ah, the bewildering fertility of the void! </p><p>When I started these studies, I thought I'd be learning how to draw really good maps, how to use a bunyip, how to analyse functions, systems and elements, and all that jazz. And of course, I have done that sort of thing, but more importantly, I've realised my shortcomings with regards to communication, to wanting to be in control, to my own rigid thinking. A resilient mind is an open and flexible mind. </p><p>Not only that, but when I talk about People Care, Earth Care and Fair Share, I have to really care, and be willing to share. Through the various projects that I have worked on, I have seen how the ethics, and the word 'community' are bandied about. Which leads me to...</p><p><strong>Personal, People, Place</strong></p><p>I shared my Community Gardens People design in Carla Moss's <a href="https://www.permaculture.org.uk/user/5068/carla-moss/diploma-tutor-profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum</a> and received lots of good advice, but I didn't have time to heed their advice. I then duly forgot about it, as I hadn't done the reflection - probably due to aversion to looking at the project any more, and then got drawn into a whole other story, where all that advice would have served me very nicely. I got back into my pattern! It wasn't until I came to writing up the design that I saw how I might have avoided those pitfalls. I did then put some of the advice to use in the next community situation.</p><p>I realised during the Community Gardens design that I wanted to work collaboratively on future designs, so I did with two designs after that. This was particularly successful in my Growing Brookside design, when I collaborated with my partner Killian. Having a different perspective and another brain to work with was a huge benefit. I felt supported, especially as I began to feel overwhelmed by the design, and he learnt a lot about the Permaculture process. </p><p>Having a body of work to look back on means that I can see my learning clearly; the patterns, the areas I need to work on in myself, to come to terms with aspects of my character and also, where to set boundaries, and how to make decisions about projects I want to get involved with in the future. I am learning so much about myself.</p><p>Doing zone 00 stuff is really important, because people work is really challenging, but it's the most crucial part to learn. Without other people, without being able to work with others, to listen and to respond compassionately, there's no point doing any other type of work. A land design will fall apart if the people working on it can't work together. This reminds me of the nested wholes of the Living Systems work - I am nested within a community that is nested within the land, and all three need to be in harmony for all to thrive. </p><p>I probably have more questions now than when I started. Does it really matter if a project doesn't have a plan? Does a Permaculture design really help a project? Is the time invested worthwhile? Afterall, as I stated previously, mistakes are the best way to learn. I suspect that it is better to have a design that doesn't work out than to not have a design at all. Because the number of designs that are implemented exactly according to plans are as rare as hens teeth. </p><p>We can be in the moment when we design, and this allows us to be completely in the moment when we action the design, because we have a well-thought out plan that supports the flow of the project. </p><p>I feel as though the Permaculture diploma has shaped my life, and Permaculture itself has been an excellent tool for this. The Regenerative Life design was in the background throughout, and each design has led me through a learning process - through projects that didn't turn out how I thought they would but that gave me incredible learning, and I think that because I was designing my way through, I was more open to the learning. And it seems as though it has all culminated in design ten, which has been positively received by the clients, and we have found a place to be where we can meet the goals we set in the Regenerative Life design.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p><p>Designed by Killian</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
