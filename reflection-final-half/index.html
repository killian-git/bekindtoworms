It's been very challenging, because I thought I'd be learning about how to make maps, how to use ...  and I have learnt a lot of that, but what I've learnt most is that it's the people stuff that matters most. I've seen it done badly. Really badly. And I don't want to replicate that. </p><p>Resilience. </p><p>I used the forum to share my Community Gardens People design, but I didn't hace time to heed their advice. I then duly forgot about it, as I hadn't done the reflection - probably due to aversion to looking at the project any more, and then got drawn into the whole Hellbent story, where all those things would have served me very nicely. I got back into my pattern!  </p><p>I realised during the CG design that I wanted to work collaboratively on future designs, and I have done so on another design.</p><p>Having a body of work to look back on means that I can see very clearly the learning, the patterns, the areas I need to work on in myself, to come to terms with aspects of my character and also, where to set boundaries, and how to make decisions about projects I want to get involved with in the future. I am learning so much about myself.</p><p>Havin completed my first five designs, I got into Carol Sanford's work, via Dan Palmer, via HDM. It has made me want to change my approach, and I would like to try to use it for my final three designs </p><p>Having a big gap in between the two main thrusts of my work has meant that some learning got forgotten, such as the difference between evaluation and reflection. </p><p> </p><p>I’ve been listening to Dan Palmer’s ‘Making Permaculture Stronger’ podcast, and it’s really ignited something in me. I was tootling along quite happily with my design work, feeling as if I’d been getting a good grasp on the Permaculture design methods, and then, all of a sudden, this stuff turns up and disrupts that. Bother. It really would have been easier if I’d just carried on as I was, because now I have to re-think how I do this.</p><p>I don’t want to use a formulaic, mechanistic approach, but I’m beginning to see that my work up until now has been. It’s been box ticking and fragmenting things.</p><p>I would like to drop the problem mindset and swap it out for a potential mindset. An approach that doesn’t impose, but instead, least things come to light organically. Now, whenever I hear people say ‘we let things develop organically’ I just translate that into ‘we make it up as we go along’ and I think that way of working means that a lot of mistakes can be made and connections go unnoticed and are therefore lost. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with mistakes, it’s part of any learning process, but how about we take time to really look at something, to consider things deeply, so that perhaps we can skip some of the mistakes that are just wasteful of energy, money and, sometimes are harmful to the environment, people (including animals)?</p><p>Imposing my will on the land or on a project or person, that is not what I’m interested in.</p><p>And so, how do I do that? How do I learn to be an intuitive designer?</p><p>Making lists, breaking things down into ‘good’ and ‘bad’/ ‘strengths’ and ‘weaknesses’ is reductive. This kind of process can lead to using generic methods or solutions, rather than seeking out developments that may fit in a more snugly.</p><p>How do I see things as a whole?</p><p>…</p><p>02.06.22</p><p>I’ve just listened to Looby Macnamara on the MPS podcast, and I’ve realised that I’ve naturally come the same conclusion that Looby did, which prompted her to create the Design Web. The fact that the design process is nonlinear. Also, she talks about people being the key limit, and that is also what I’ve realised through my time at Wibsey, through the Community Gardens People design and the Boundaries design.</p><p>I realised how important the Four Questions are, and that I can use them when I’m a bit stuck, which is why I’m using them now,</p><p>And I also thought about how I have recently started thinking about becoming a Permaculture tutor/teacher…</p><p>And the importance of the names for our designs- I really don’t like the name Community Gardens; People, maybe I need to rethink that, or at least realise that in the future I could give the names of my design a good deal more thought.</p><p> </p><p><strong>So what’s going well?</strong></p><p>I’ve submitted seven of the ten designs. I’m organised, I’m motivated and I’ve got a brilliant set-up here at Brookside, with time, space (a brilliant space - -my office!) at this beautiful farm, support from Brookside and Killian, and my #100daysofpermaculture is going really well and its giving me a lot of momentum to get this diploma finished. The fact that I’m having muy accreditation event at the National Convergence is also hugely motivating.</p><p>I feel as though there are a lot of things coming together in my mind, and the process is really rich. I feel as if something is emerging.</p><p>This morning I woke with an anxious feeling in my heart, like I had to be getting on with something, like I had to do something, and I realised that that is how I wake up most mornings. And I remembered that that isn’t true, I don’t need to be worried, I can let life lead me, and that when I’m feeling demotivated and refer to it as ‘lazy’ I can relax and do something else, look at it differently. Yesterday I listened to some podcasts on the MPS website  and then was inspired to write to Dan Palmer. He wrote back a really cool response, so I wonder where that is going to lead?!</p><p>But back to the relaxing thing, I had that as one of my key aims for this year, that I would learn to relax, and this process is helping me do that, to steer me away from stressful situations like jobs that are very much aligned with the old paradigm (I don’t really know what that means exactly, but that understanding is forming).</p><p> </p><p><strong>What has been challenging?</strong></p><p>Having finished those last two designs, I got into this living systems stuff and It’s been such a rabbit hole, at a time when it is extremely inconvenient, and I guess it is destabilising. But then, as Burgs says, we need to learn to be stable in our instability. I actually love that all my thinking is being disrupted and that I’m having to look deeper, to ask questions and to wonder, WTF? Are many of us perpetuating the same old crap, recycled into something that looks like something different?</p><p>The big challenge is knowing how to assimilate this into my final three designs. Fuck.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What are your long-term visions and goals?</strong></p><p>To submit my final three designs by the 7<sup>th</sup> of July, and then to get them all on my website looking really nice, and very accessible. And then to present my accreditation event at the National Convergence. And to do all of this being relaxed and in flow.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What are your next achievable steps?</strong></p><p>I’m a bit stuck with my WoBw design, so I’m going to look again at my RL design.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p><p>Designed by Killian</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://killian-git.github.io/bekindtoworms/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
